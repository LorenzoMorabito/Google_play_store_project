Not to mention the fact that the navigator sometimes offers dirt roads instead of normal ones. I spent the whole night at the track this winter."

It is filled with a bunch of advertisements for the fake landlord or agent!! 喔... For advertising, it may be the main source of income for 591, so it will be designed so that the tenant/buyer is not easy to search for a house, because this company does not care about the tenants’ lives, because they want advertising revenue!!

1464,8 Ball Pool,"The spin modelled correctly. Backspin nothing! And number times I watched balls potted slower balls hit opponent go in. On top white ball rolls way much even low power!

Believe better pool game eventually everyone go one, I know I Wii problem keeps up."
1476,8 Ball Pool,The game rigged completely. Spin wheel never pays big. The extra guideline removed certain level. Shots defy basic law physics matter here.
1477,8 Ball Pool,"A Classic. Cant beat good, quick game 8 ball. Even rookies noobies enjoy, isn't really learning curve. Only downside requires connection play."

1495,8 Ball Pool,The thing I would like see done. Is lower level player get stuck higher level. And game wheel hit big numbers small number ever time.
1496,8 Ball Pool,"Great game, I dropped star new update clubs glitchy; club leaderboard constantly displays inaccurate amounts, example, said I 67mil Id 330mil, went 150 mil, dropped again, since ive 1.05bill, says Ive 450 something million, make sense thats near even half ive whilst club, profit margin ive either. Please fix"

The room found going cost money, even $185 credit, ultimately even available late contact host. After stranded hours waiting Airbnb, I told nothing me. They offered $100 credit future trip. So I drove 4 hours ways, probably spending $100 gas, offered $100 Airbnb hosts left me, pregnant wife, & dog without place stay. Very disappointed. I looking different vendors VRBO future."

5094,Airport + Flight Tracker Radar,"This good tracking flight. It's extremely slow annoying. Searching flights booking hassle; better going directly airline's website.

5173,Akinator,"This good game, sure, feature makes hate it. Not once, twice I PAY I got ""vip"" character. And let ad option either! All I wanted play game, every GOOD character I get vip. This feature SUCKS I stop playing mind changed feature still exists. Also I good internet lags. One last thing, dont pick hard characters. Akinator either vip get"
5174,Akinator,"This game makes watch ad figure chosen half time gets wrong. It's fun can't get answer. way game works fully free, waste money game"
5175,Akinator,"It's kinda freaky hey, cool! And VIP thing. I'm wasting money it. It says watch video yeah yeah never works. Oh I also hate makes mistakes like I say blonde hair, says black hair. I understand that. Please fix it."
5176,Akinator,This dumb. You're trying make Akinator think obscure characters obscure characters locked behind pay wall. What's point I pay money see answers? Also already littered ads large pay barrier? There way better free less ads.
5177,Akinator,This crazy first try bam it. I chose ones even people know knew! Crazy guy I'm bit freeked hey great game thank u creaters
5178,Akinator,"This sucked. Doesn't guess anything says ""get vip character 1.99$"" Who would even waste money stupid app? I would rate 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 stars could. Thats I feel app. Also took almost storage phone. Plz get rid it."
5179,Akinator,"Previous version much much better. This needs questions, makes lot mistakes full ads. I dont understand needs microphone front camera. But dont like all."
5180,Akinator,"It's alright, pretty fun. Sometimes, actually alot time I get Technical Issues. That gets annoying. If I hit continue game says message again. Please fix"
5181,Akinator,"In short, game stupid. He asks questions multiple times, never gets moderately uncommon characters right first time (which annoying get award round), questions always place desultory. It fun play. Would recommend."
5182,Akinator,"I saw many people saying game way better really bad now. I installed game I know. To fun, honestly! He guessed every time, even little bit information character! And also I'm playing game I feeling like actually read mind, knows exactly questions ask! I love this! :))"
5183,Akinator,"This used good app, game guess character first try win award. That would ok try guess handful questions. Horrible guessing anything anime characters video games."
5184,Akinator,"This amazing crash. When thought person I said pressed continue, progress bar stayed full time asked questions over. Then crashed. So sometimes I never able guess character I chose."
5185,Akinator,This good game I think different variations like catogory different levels things like I found lottle boring games also cool I tinking time I try guess 1st question genie! another thing I would like add I think things make interesting like things I wrote before.
5186,Akinator,"love game let guess baldi. So game cool, guess character youtubers like DanTDM, Jacksepticeye, Pewdiepie famous youtubers world. Ill try famous show game, well sometimes he's wrong means beat him."
5187,Akinator,I love game I rate low bc working anymore.. says something technical problem... even start takes Tried multiple times.. Same problem. Plz fix!!!
5188,Akinator,"kept crashing wouldnt let anything. would start ""a problem occurred"" give option start new game continue playing turn clicking keep playing would make crash continuously saying message"
5189,Akinator,"I loved game, freaks right every time I guess Sometimes I even try favorite actors... he's right. Though odd click, lemme give example. When guy says ""Is charecter human"" I yes, says ""Is charecter dolphin"" Thats I found odd, besides I love game!"
5190,Akinator,"Really good ask questions lead person character thinking of, fr example I thought aunt's dog guessed cousins fog aunt kids also friend picked guessed best friend cool real!!!!"
5191,Akinator,Very fun 20 questions type app. I happy see GooglePlay. I great time asking Akinator questions. Sometimes I stump times gets right first guess
5192,Akinator,To many ads first Akinator geuss person VIP reasons see answer?!what! Well I'm paying even I got delete game stupid I mean alright except VIP thing I mean I can't believe akinator needs money bad keep business going saying VIP reasons know VIP reasons agree support comment put like comment. Thanks
5193,Akinator,Used love app! Now crashes every 15 questions never guess simple characters! Too many ads well. Disappointed.
5194,Akinator,"Almost every time find VIP character attempt watch video, video never works. This makes game really annoying play without buying potion. Other that, game fun kind addicting."
5195,Akinator,"OK, pretty cool. BUT 1 ad, THE SCARIEST AD EVER. It gave NIGHTMARES. DON'T DOWNLOAD IF U DON'T WANNA BE SCARED. And, also, earlier version WAY BETTER This little kids, getting rewards, charging 1.99, JUST 4 A VIP CHARACTER??!?!?!??! NO JUST NO"
5197,Akinator,So fun play top option record screen. So I always usually every single time says can't play video. That totally stupid
5198,Akinator,This actually used good app. Now cannot even guess one. A bot discord works better. I tried twenty different characters... got 3 right. That's 15%. That F- I rate app. And seriously VIP characters stupidest thing I ever heard of. Zero ten again. And creepy anime adds Japanese.
5200,Akinator,"Cool concept. Fun game. When works. Game keeps crashing shows prompt says ""Experienced technical difficulties"". Please fix this. Paid get rid ads I think I already regret it. Description says fixed bug true."

5206,Akinator,"It's pretty fun, thirst money real. ""VIP"" characters? Really? Couldn't come better excuse? There's ads literally every round, sorry excuse ""vip characters"" put another ad see akinator guessed? Please remove thing, annoying, already get enough ads, put ad see result?"
5207,Akinator,It alright I hate VIP characters thing. When I get VIP character adverts work.
5208,Akinator,OMG I got it. 5 stars I specific said doctor squish Junie b Jones. Scared

6093,Alto's Adventure,"I absolutely love game, night cycle really takes away game. There times cycles around night game completely unplayed due fact I can't see anything. I like constantly go bump brightness exiting re-entering game reset day/night cycle. If could toggle day night cycle even set certain time day, I would rate five stars sure."
6094,Alto's Adventure,"Great game! Keeps focussed, demand much attention. That way making mind relaxed. And gameplay always interesting, small details change level buy upgrades. As changes small really makes easy feel game. It's really balanced full harmony. It's long since I've enjoyed game much. From similar games I've played Temple run 2. Played lot! But game completely different league! Really big thanks developers app! I like much even ads really disturb me. And means lot."
6096,Alto's Adventure,Great game. I wish move name character lands small piece land two chasms. I mean think going arch using wingsuit would worthy move. The move I mentioned lot harder satisfying able it. Give justice. Haha. That all.
6097,Alto's Adventure,"The reason I give 5 stars I issues hover feather working. I'll turn blue hover. I find way contact bug, I guess I'll post hope best? Other game wonderful. Best game I've downloaded long time."

6101,Alto's Adventure,"Interesting hard see obstacles, watching ad continue working me. often times game becomes unresponsive I try. So... I start every 25 seconds spend $5... Sorry spending bat game stable pure Android device that's date. Hope upcoming sequel better."
6102,Alto's Adventure,"This hands best game I've phone date. From minimalist visuals music, fantastic game. Never I bought premium game amount time I've put Alto, least I could return. Keep mind absolutely put money game great time. The leveling system sometimes character specific challenges even buy characters premium, still cant progress without trying everyone least times! The quipp I I wish I could pick side wingsuit button could lot time I'm playing game handed difficult reach across. I play game daily, it, get it."
6105,Alto's Adventure,"I never write reviews first foremost. I absolutely love game, graphics beautiful really reflected soundtrack sends transient state play, subtle, simple stunning. While idle ""tap tap"" game, fully engrosses relaxes time. The game I device, Odyssey released course. Thanks hard work, keep up. Perfection."
6106,Alto's Adventure,"Love game. Fun, intuitive, progession system makes playing rewarding. Only complaint -- day/night cycle seems favour night. The game looks gorgeous day I spend time squinting screen trying make rocks dark."
6107,Alto's Adventure,"I would continue playing game fingers get tired, I'm absolutely fed watch 20 30 seconds clips every time I take tumble. Or, I start over. Surely guys offer paid version ads. Until then, I'm going pass. Please rethink ads."
6108,Alto's Adventure,"I started game thinking fun, unlocking Maya character mobility, game became lot fun. Some goals progress levels frustrating randomly generated levels making seem impossible sometimes, still hooks enough keep playing. Being able play offline huge upside too. Thanks developer offering that."
6109,Alto's Adventure,"In opinion, game perfect. No bugs crashes, yet. Art style simple, yet combined weather effects daylight changes, gorgeous sight. The best thing game watching sunrise, beautiful. And ads even problem, instantly, purchases affect gameplay. Controls simple mastered, really fun take risks."

6185,Alto's Adventure,Love game. Don't know randomly shows advertisement ls sexual related content. Lame
6186,Alto's Adventure,"This game free pushes greater tolerance shortcomings. But oh god, ad spamming ridiculous?! I'll start game: uses interesting approach allowing player run day night. But since game's main obstacles rocks jump avoid looking silhouette, gets annoying jump night time. At least give players option turn night time. And tutorial touches bare minimum makes hard advance past earlier runs. It's amusing people highly rate zen mode (because main mode). There point tap quickly longer jump game. Finally, mad deluge ads, run ends suddenly hit ad even ask (I'm fine watching ad I want freebies want chance continue run). I've even hit ads cannot closed never end. How serviceable game?? Also, Paz oaf."
6187,Alto's Adventure,Good chill music effortless snowboarding time killer. Very polished game design well. Just desperately waiting odyssey. ??? Release date

I like made thunder realistic, 'cause made sure sound plays seconds see it. I love woods. And lastly I love point view ""turns"" sideways bit pass buildings look 3D! The alpacas cute nice included them! The thing I could possibly mind sound skiing rain setting really want hear rain I like skiing sound."
6201,Alto's Adventure,"This good game. However game mechanics fairly balanced, especially starting level 20. I describe 50% luck, 40% waiting, 10% skill. Some goals almost impossible achieve within reasonable time limits. It's possible spend hours day playing repeating failed levels. But want spare 5-15 day impossible."
6205,Alto's Adventure,Give option turn night mode make aesthetic thing only. It's irritating sunny already hard see screen. You expect able see tiny little snowboarder he's 3 shades darker everything else screen? It's hard even right lighting infuriating enough make write review.
6218,Alto's Adventure,I waited Obyssey months. And officially support device:(. I downloaded apk version Huawei mate 10 though works fine. Plz let us legal version:( I play alto adventure zen mode every night. I obsessed Obyssey.

6292,Amazon Drive,"Useable annoying. I recommend Amazon Drive simply because, Android okay, PC sync broken mess, makes frustrating manage files. Google drive One Drive similarly priced better."
6293,Amazon Drive,"Up recently I loved app. Now longer backs photos like I idea why. I try uninstalling reinstalling see makes difference, blows chunks. :("
6294,Amazon Drive,"Disappointed !! It unlimited storage went back words, limited 1TB. I wouldnt recommend. I paid prime, unlimited music cloud drive looking similar provider."
6295,Amazon Drive,"Pretty standard cloud storage major flaw. Once tell upload something, seems way cancel it. It also seems made local copy file waits upload using 4GB storage trying upload I want cancel. I contacted amazon support amazon drive team available chat support wait get back you. They said take 24 hours I've heard back."

6298,Amazon Drive,"Seems issues downloading image folders cloud, onto Android. Also, selecting Amazon Drive alternative uploading image normal gallery, work 75% time."
6299,Amazon Drive,"I amazon amazon prime I buy a lot music. yet I try play later dates there, available, comes random number amazon customer help doesn't even understand. I hate get back system I'm paying alot money for."
6300,Amazon Drive,"Amazon scammers. Twice, I cancelled services, Amazon continued bill hundreds dollars. They claim customer oriented firm lie. Use services great caution."
6302,Amazon Drive,Having 717GB data backed brings peace mind. It's super fast upload (where back services painstakingly slow) - I uploaded less 24 hours.
6304,Amazon Drive,"I like Amazon Drive easy way move store temporary devices, especially running space. Good cloud anything free."
6305,Amazon Drive,"Overall job. One annoying thing browsing subdirectories, scrolling down, whenever I press back jumps back top directory list I scroll again. This fixed ☺"
6306,Amazon Drive,"This mess, can't seem even see what's currently cloud drive. Also pc sync terrible mess, keep track changed properly"
6307,Amazon Drive,"1) Absolutely No way select photos ones uploaded ( upload one! Are kidding ? ) , matter upload source phone choose . 2) No way copying within (only moving another place folder ) 3) No way manage Amazon Cloud major File Managing App! ""Samsung Files"" Asus' ""File Manager"" can't See Amazon Cloud drive see ""Google Drive"" Microsoft's ""One drive""! 4) Thumbnails images blurry! How multi billion company design poor cloud ? Hire design manager!"
6308,Amazon Drive,Great stored many different devices. No ads even better save's PDF photos videos documents printable documents works great ads even better would recommend anyone likes online storage great love
6309,Amazon Drive,Simple works well. Could better features like playing entire folder mp3 instead 1 time password protection access app.
6310,Amazon Drive,Great interface easy use. I wish storage free 5gb I can't really complain about. If I like I'll probably upgrade storage
6311,Amazon Drive,"It's lame, slow, useless. Good drive much better."

6313,Amazon Drive,installed device default music player stopped working. uninstalling music player start working
6315,Amazon Drive,"Not good. No progress indicator uploads. Either 'uploading' 'waiting' . User control pause restart, idea what's going on. Very poor app."
6316,Amazon Drive,(1)The Trash folder whereas laptop view same.(2) The PC NOT work like windows folder messy whereas One Drive works beautifully (3) The syncing cell PC really cumbersome procedure.
6317,Amazon Drive,This ate data constantly updating background install peril slow cumbersome stick google
6319,Amazon Drive,What Rubbish amazon big company data uploading better UI nothing good except 1TB cloud storage attract plenty Developers If know meant google drive teach u plenty things want convey...First time disappointed amazon really bad....
6320,Amazon Drive,Eh.. 5gb storage amazon prime customer? I expected atleast 15+ oh well.
6321,Amazon Drive,Excellent cloud service. With Prime free unlimited photo storage 5GB free file storage. 100GB storage $12 per year 1TB storage $60 per year. Pretty good do!
6322,Amazon Drive,It lot things improve compare google drive drive
6323,Amazon Drive,"I installed couple weeks ago, upload anything even open initial setup. In couple weeks file size went 10mb 1.5gb. Going file manager see stored showed nothing.. Hmmm"
6324,Amazon Drive,Needs automatic camera upload cell phone.. that's added useless
6325,Amazon Drive,"This best payment option Google play store, asking credit card number details subscription . Google please check it..."

6933,Amtrak,"It finally getting better recent updates, I give credit. Still, I make purchase using app, reward points option easily accessible within app? Why leave app, go complete purchase, back show ticket? I thought Select member would make things easier.... This reflects sad state railway system comparison advanced countries.."
6934,Amtrak,"Like reviews, worst thing know reservation number totally defeats purpose app. If gets fixed showed upcoming trips automatically logged would decent. You buy change tickets, see account info basic updates."

6936,Amtrak,"Ridiculously clumsy, clunky app. Like something developed back early 2000s. Newest version even let redeem points purchase tickets."
6937,Amtrak,"This got dumbest ill conceived I ever used. First login system gives indication logged in. Second reservations unless I key reso number email. Seriously? Third, hire someone edit text. Your grammar atrocious; e.g. ex. If know Latin insult dead language. Finally consult NIST modern password guidance. Your arcane password rules helping anyone feel secure."
6938,Amtrak,"Too buggy. Won't remember single trip, I need memorize reservation #. Sometimes connect I strong internet, says data connection. Pretty clunky. If everything right shows QR code."
6940,Amtrak,"I cant find list pending trips without reservation numbers even I'm logged in. So, looks need paper ticket get electronic ticket. Not helpful."
6941,Amtrak,"I tried change ticket july 24th august 1st, least 10 times. It looked confirmed it, yet opened 25th july, still says ticket 24th july. So I guess I spent money nothing. Wont going amtrak anymore."

6943,Amtrak,"Basic functionality still buggy. After around 9 PM, schedule disapperas says trains available, false."
6944,Amtrak,Even update I still problem others. I need re-enter reservation info everytime I app.
6945,Amtrak,Doesn't give info status train crosses next day unless train number like everyone else said I guess care. And important Amtrak seeing trains many delays. So sit station wait certain cities pain. I waited long daughter last week coming florence sc Penn station following week I looking pay check. The train departed flo 20 minutes late supposed arrive 11:58 PM came station 3:49am came 4:26am criminal. Now daughter going train meet someone clock like next week NO CHECK. You think people r collecting would try fix that. But look reviews long delays. A working right giving real time updates times current status trains would make life much easier. Delays happen that's life can't helped. Keeping live updates hard. In world people stand street knows right uber lift r possible keep track Big Old train. I'm saying.
6946,Amtrak,Worked much better recent update. Not user friendly
6947,Amtrak,Not great. Difficult sort based ticket choice criteria
6948,Amtrak,Too hard retrieve purchased ticket. I keep entering info everytime. Not fan !

And I deleted stuff, number megabytes I delete literally increased! Besides, could game need THAT much room play it? There way I'm gonna delete pictures stuff phone this. Your game takes 3 GB, storage taken phone 1.2 GB. So even I delete everything phone, I still enough space. Pathetic."
9313,Asphalt 8: Airborne,"With bit patience comes saving credits, best racing game around store. Great soundtrack, too. Minus star many advertisements glitchy multiplayer mode recent updates."
9314,Asphalt 8: Airborne,Good basic game stunningly bad interface. The UI seems designed make accidentally buy things. Some races take 25 button presses start. Race info displayed bold text blocking view track racing. It's like dev team never played game

9323,Asphalt 8: Airborne,"Nice game...was nice.You play suddenly lost points, every f... week. Cheating. Multiplayer- race car class B versus class A? Technical support never, never help you."
9325,Asphalt 8: Airborne,"This could 5 star app. It's got totally awesome graphics, plenty cool tracks, cars & sport bikes. The problems VERY lagy & slow. This freezes often. Running updates takes forever. The controls need better. Controlling vehicles pain time. This game frustrating. I'm hoping improvements..."

9333,Asphalt 8: Airborne,"Dear Gameloft, worrying introduce serious bug(multiplayer delay) day can't even fix 4 months. I spent lot money support game, bought good cars play multiplayer. But wasted now. I missed many token cars I could win multiplayer champion league. You disappointing. I regret spent much time, money efforts game. I quit game get life. Lesson learnt though, future, I careful game developer I pick games from. It certainly you."

9452,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Works well
9453,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,I do not have a waypoint.
9454,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Seemed like good worked day. The next day, navigation longer working. It always shows ""Routing limit exceeded.""."
9455,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Please get rid of it in English and let me choose Korean. It has not been written since the update. It is a mess. Thank you very much for your hard work.
9456,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"I'm using an English phone, and I am using Hangul, and everything is changed to English while I am updating it. I also mixed before, but I hope I can change the language in the app .. I can not use it now ... Thank you"
9457,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"I have used it many times now because it is excellent in Xian. The first time I used it, the arrival time was one hour, and I was pissed off ... It is the way from Yongin to Yeouido ..."
9458,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"I was worried about opening windows because of fine dust during driving, but it is too easy to display on the navigation screen. 3D maps are much more intuitive than 2D. But in the background, when you touch the mini guide, you should not go directly to the app and you have to hold it."
9459,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Map download function that worked normally until last time (3.4.032) It does not work after this update It does not work,"
9460,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,It is good to be able to choose the voice guidance by the street.
9461,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,good driving korea thanks
9462,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Good quality
9464,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Perfect navigation
9465,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Best
9467,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Suddenly, I can not get GPS. I am writing because it is the strongest of the real-time fast road. After the update, the GPS is fixed near the active station. However, the current location is good for other map applications. How can it not be solved? The model I'm wearing is Lenovo Vibe Shot."
9468,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,I received a familiar Atlnap app because of the sudden breakdown of Find Live Navi.
9471,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Hi Best
9472,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Fixed to Atlanta 1 year oleenbi & gt; Naver Navigation & gt; I moved to Atlantic Navigator. The advantage of the old Ole Nevi is that it has the best gas station in the route and it was good but it disappeared and Naver was still uneasy about visibility and guidance except the web link function. At this time, the Atlantean UI has been changed, so it is more visibility and I do not regret using it fixedly. NAVIGATION GUIDE NAVIGATION FOR VEHICLE NAVIGATION is satisfactory. Thank you for a more stable update."
9473,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Easy and practical navigation! The interface is neat, so it is easy and easy to use the navigation for people who use the sound insulation ~ And downloading the map in advance to reduce the data is also very attractive! But sometimes I do not know if it's only on my cell that the GPS is getting late or the route modification is late. It was near Namyangju, Toegyewon, and there was a slight buzz. The model is Galaxy Alpha. I do not know if it is a problem with my phone. Thank you ~"
9474,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Recommandable navigation Recommended navigation
9475,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,It's all broken up ...
9476,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,I like the gel navi ~ ♥
9477,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"It's nice because I do not have any ads. If possible, if you have received the map in advance, you should be able to use it even if there is no network connection."
9478,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"It is very good. I wonder why you distribute such a good program free of charge ... !!! Where does the revenue come from? I feel free to write a free program that I will use for a fee, and I have a curious question about it!"
9479,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,It turns off immediately when it is opened very suddenly. Please correct me.
9480,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Status bar Hide function ??? I would like to use the status bar hidden in full screen.
9481,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Improvements Overall good. Current speed information far small. And needs larger visual sign approaching speed camera.
9482,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Name can not be displayed The name of the building can not be displayed. I can not see the range. g4
9483,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Uses alot Data
9484,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,How change English?
9485,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Socks.
9486,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,You ....
9487,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,love
9488,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Good !! The design is also nice and clean. Sometimes I do not catch my position very well ... but there are no ads, it's free, convenient and good."
9489,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,"Thank you. I am writing very well, but I am very sorry for the start screen. I would like a nice title screen suitable for the device. And if full-screen mode for tablet models is also supported, there's nothing to worry about"
9490,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,Zoshi Singing Vixen
9491,Atlan3D Navigation: Korea navigator,ui is better than other Nevi apps. It is very familiar with the sound of a long time using the navigation system dedicated to navigation.

10947,BZWBK24 mobile,"The application is correct, but the design leaves a lot of wishes, cooperation with the fingerprint reader is limited only to log only one case. The application is quite slow poorly optimized. Some elements of the app are almost archaic. Problem with saving confirmations in PDF. When I save the confirmation, I save it as a 0 Kb non-open file, then I save it using an external file manager, in my case Solid Explorer, it works fine."
10948,BZWBK24 mobile,"Well, here's a lot to say. It works fine without being able to view your account status without logging in. The functionality is the same as on the website."
10949,BZWBK24 mobile,"What a parody if you do not remember NIK, no one will give it to you, not a bell because it is a waste of frustration. The old Polish time lost has not been settled. I live in the west no ników only #karty I pass tel 800 will solve your problem. Not like Poland paranoia .. Hehehe Russian goes ... Hehehe credit card will run through but you will not run without NIK .. Hehehe simple you do not have an account handle .."

For example category animal like 8 12 animal total. The category numbers also around 8. After suggestions, bad meaning. But parent I would like see game even creative helping kids think also creativity. Good game kids!"

12139,Banco Itaú,"In the middle of 2018 and Itaú still does not offer access option via biometrics. Simply embarrassing. And then it looks like a propaganda stick saying it's a modern, digital bank."
12140,Banco Itaú,"The big problem is Itoken. I often travel to England and are afraid of losing my cell phone. Why have an Itoken cell phone that can break and get lost? Totally absurd. Nationwide has a Card Reader where you insert your card for Internet access. Why Itau does not have it? I already spoke with two representatives of Itaú and they wake up. The cellular is worse place to have an Itoken. The is good actually, it usually works well, problem is Itoken. And also, I can not unlock international travel by the app, says I have to call SOS Internet."
12141,Banco Itaú,No more to see the credit card launches ... make sure to make it worse than okay ...
12142,Banco Itaú,"Again with error in the barcode reads, recognizes and does nothing."
12143,Banco Itaú,I use it quite application and it heed my needs a single point that leaves you want is barcode reader. It takes time to read and sometimes it can not.
12144,Banco Itaú,"It does everything that is expected of a bank, has simple and intuitive interface. It could improve on the help side by offering more links to information, but overall pretty good!"
12145,Banco Itaú,"Live asking to evaluate, I always come and update evaluation with 1 star. How much longer are they going to pack up? Bank waste"
12146,Banco Itaú,"There are more options missing, importing pdfs and information as extracts to email ... I always need to use PC, this only serves to pay quick accounts and monitor balance."
12147,Banco Itaú,"It's generally good, but frequent bugs give work at inopportune times. It usually crashes whenever I need more and I can not use to pay bills, even taking the ticket data you are required to type everything."
12148,Banco Itaú,"I use for mobile transfers, payments and charges. In these matters I do not have to complain. I used 2 years ago, I noticed instability only 2 times. The updates made were great. The barcode reading and copy / paste clipboard are very useful."
12149,Banco Itaú,"Quick, handy is Copy / Paste's function of lines of code for easy payment."
12150,Banco Itaú,"It does not have the same Itaucard functions, making me need to install the two apps. A trash!"
12151,Banco Itaú,Bloody not detailing more invoice card app! And they still want people to go digital ... unfortunate.
12152,Banco Itaú,Frequent unavailability and undocumented errors in transactions as well as lack of feedback on errors in the application section.
12153,Banco Itaú,"It works very well, but sometimes it gives a few problems when it comes to logging in. No more, all right."
12154,Banco Itaú,"I live outside Brazil and every time Bank changes security system application becomes useless because I need to authorize it in an ATM, which they do not have in China. I also do not use more previous phone number and I have no way to change it outside. In other words, without access to my account."
12155,Banco Itaú,It does not allow payments of Inter bank tickets. I had to use desktop version.
12156,Banco Itaú,No longer shows values ​​on invoice card
12157,Banco Itaú,"Improvement of this version 6.5.7: You evaluate and when closing the lock app, parabens continue so testing very well app !!! Browser in app ... ""Sorry we're in maintenance we're back soon"""
12158,Banco Itaú,icone itoken payment asked did not think. Tbem not le bar payment
12159,Banco Itaú,Lack of option to pay DARF income tax
12160,Banco Itaú,Why can not Hipercard pay?
12161,Banco Itaú,Send me to electronic box.
12162,Banco Itaú,Very practical and reliable!
12163,Banco Itaú,It makes life so much easier.
12164,Banco Itaú,"Features are awesome! Especially for who's kind of virtual account. The iToken via app / SMS, is very practical! I can do almost anything by cell phone. Now with Fingerprint access has become much faster and safer! Command vouchers directly by whatsapp / email with just one button (share) app. Tip: Let tags be placed on your postings (debits, docs / TEDs or recipes) so we would filter through those tags when searching. This will greatly improve control, search and preview extract."
12165,Banco Itaú,It's difficult to defend
12166,Banco Itaú,Help me too much
12167,Banco do Brasil,"Lol, from Brazil bank are a joke. To what application should everything need to go agency or ATM? Otherwise, everything is wrong. All. Bb code, biometrics. Bb and Itaú are competing to see which world's worst banking service."
12168,Banco do Brasil,Banco Brasil has implemented international transfer module and now I give 5 stars. Congratulations! You just need to enable Google Pay and Samsung Pay without needing another application.
12169,Banco do Brasil,"Very good app. I solve almost everything I need for him. There's only one problem: after a certain time, I can not pay bills! And that causes problems ..."
12170,Banco do Brasil,"It would be great if you did not shut yourself up all the time, even on a good quality device with updated software. Notifications are bugged and old messages can not always be reached. Need to improve on bugs. The ux has a good proposal, but it does not work well in practice."
12171,Banco do Brasil,"It has been 2 months since it stopped working. It opens, but with the menus, offering no option to use."
12172,Banco do Brasil,"Again giving error, I can not enter the account. I called for help, asked to send email and nothing so far"
12173,Banco do Brasil,"You are giving QR CODE error. The image is distorted, and only in that app, it can not read QR CODE, so I can not confirm any operation."
12174,Banco do Brasil,"The BB application is consuming a lot of battery power. There's a looping process or something. On Android it is always first in the list of power consumption, even when not in use."
12175,Banco do Brasil,"Pretty bad. It does not allow use if cellular is not registered, and it does not accept registration of external tel. TED and DOC do not work. It would be smarter to use a password counter system, like other banks."
12176,Banco do Brasil,"It's still a better market, but a lot of bugs have appeared and it's taking time to solve ..."
12177,Banco do Brasil,In the tablet home page is bugada .. bb code button is hidden and I can not access
12178,Banco do Brasil,"The application works, but layout is very outdated and bad. You need to upgrade your app and make it more instinctive."
12179,Banco do Brasil,Should be able to change payment limit via without going to the bank.
12180,Banco do Brasil,"BB code does not work. Unable to enable, always returns error."
12181,Banco do Brasil,"The application is very fast, beautiful and efficient."
12182,Banco do Brasil,"Sometimes it gets slow, but overall it's very good."
12183,Banco do Brasil,For any application I need to go to the Garbage Agency
12184,Banco do Brasil,"Great app, easy to understand layout and well laid out."
12185,Banco do Brasil,Best bank ever!
12186,Banco do Brasil,Almost I go agency I done
12187,Banco do Brasil,"When I try to edit custom menu, it locks"
12188,Banco do Brasil,Problems with locking have been resolved. Great performance.
12189,Banco do Brasil,Needs to join Android biometrics system
12190,Banco do Brasil,I can not find any more BB code

12192,Banco do Brasil,very good. Highly recommended
12193,Banco do Brasil,"Very good app, I everything I need Bank account."
12194,Banco do Brasil,"Great app, keep your promise."
12195,Banco do Brasil,Adaptive icon missing

12203,Banco do Brasil,Excellent deal banking chores. I can't see standing line ever again! I year update credit data. A dream come true! I've hated go bank pay simple bill. Keep improving I'll love even more!
12204,Banco do Brasil,Both Banco Brasil and Ourocard do not allow biometrics access to my Samsung Tab S 8.4 tablet. (UPDATE: THE FORCE use the screen of my Samsung TAB S 8.4 tablet horizontally and the screen design itself is vertical.) The biometrics still do not work. working on this Wifi + 4G tablet).
12205,Banco do Brasil,"It is a good application, quite affordable and a great time and queue saver, since you can perform transfers, payments and etc. However, it could be a little more functional, allowing more authority to the client without going to the bank or service desk."
12206,Banco do Brasil,"Countless crashes. It only shows new messages after exiting app, when then I need to enter again to check messages."
12207,Bancomer móvil,"I thought it was a mistake, but it turns out that if I accept the facial recognition the application closes, but if I say that I agree or stay locked. Facial recognition should be mandatory. Refuse update, hopefully solve it soon."
12208,Bancomer móvil,"the user who wants to use the facial fingerprint has the option to use it ... they talk about it being optional, however, when they want to enter, entering a password asks to enter your facial fingerprint without leaving ... regrettable that they oblige me to compromise my information in this way, even though the bank I consider it more secure, I have the right to decide ..."
12209,Bancomer móvil,"Horrible I can use it without activating the facial recognition, but when trying to register the service, it simply arrives with an error, impossible to connect with the remote server. Basuraaaa"
12210,Bancomer móvil,"Facial recognition is more a user's visual record than a security measure. It is unacceptable that this is mandatory, apart from the fact that its recognition system is a simple photo that any person could make fun of. They were very good but this kind of thing makes the users of their service doubt. A decision that implements is well thought out or executed."
12211,Bancomer móvil,"I could not use the application since the facial fingerprint is mandatory. The mark error when taking the facial trace, tried in multiple ways. Revert the mandatory facial fingerprint until the problem is resolved"
12212,Bancomer móvil,"Terrible that facial recognition is now mandatory. More than one hour trying to enter ... Keep saying: ""Internal error during the process"" ... Please: can you support me to enter my account? Thank you."
12213,Bancomer móvil,"Facial recognition is the worst, in my cell phone I do not even open the camera, I try another brand error contact with the server. Remove this update to manage the account you hire."
12214,Bancomer móvil,"The latest updated version 10.78 asks to forcefully enter the facial print the application always shows an ""error during the process"" takes several days so please update it"
12215,Bancomer móvil,"The person who accepted the release of facial recognition should already be working at Bancomer, is a serious unsustainable error. Then that's why you change Santander."
12216,Bancomer móvil,"Error with the server to register facial fingerprint, now it lets you do nothing because it is mandatory to close the session."
12217,Bancomer móvil,"Facial recognition is now mandatory when trying to activate it shows ""Internal error during the process"" without this requirement the already allows you to enter, today July 30 can be used for that reason, all for a function implemented mediocre. Bancomer line did nothing but raise a report gave no answer solution."
12218,Bancomer móvil,"Weigh the idea of ​​implementing mandatory facial recognition. Above all, your registration process works. Today Jul 30 it is impossible to enter the application"
12219,Bancomer móvil,"I already gave him the worst rating for his chingadera facial recognition, pure mistake, I can use my digital account, gg."
12220,Bancomer móvil,"Mandatory facial recognition weighs on the experience of the application. Before it was useful simple to use now even if you take the photo, always says there was an error."
12221,Bancomer móvil,"Facial recognition works is an attack on privacy. The is 100% unusable, impossible to log in"
12222,Bancomer móvil,"Since the facial registration became mandatory, I can enter my account, and I try to register, I always get an error, I can not access it, I will have to change the bank."
12223,Bancomer móvil,"It does not please that facial recognition is mandatory; In addition, the server has an error, it is impossible to use the application."
12224,Bancomer móvil,It was very. Well before the last update. Please reverse the change of the facial imprint. I always get the server error now I can access my bank.
12225,Bancomer móvil,"The previous version worked well, in this when trying to enter any credit card comes the following error. Java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException (Index: 1, Size: 1)"
12226,Bancomer móvil,"ERASE THE APP. UPDATE THE ANDROID VERSION AND INSTALL IT AGAIN AND THE PROBLEM FOLLOWS. THE PHOTOS THAT I HAVE TAKEN COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUEST (PROBE WITH EXCELLENT LIGHT, OUTSIDE CO. DAY LIKE 25 PHOTOS AND FOLLOWING THE FAILING PORQUERIA .... The new requirement of biometrics with photography is a true disgust. enter the application because it sends an error when you want to register the application crashea.The photograph meets all the requirements.Help support yesterday passed the 5th other telephone number where they did not even answer."
12227,Bancomer móvil,"I have been unable to register my facial print for 5 days, INTERNAL ERROR DURING THE PROCESS, what do I do? I uninstall it?"
12228,Bancomer móvil,He asks me to register my facial still having an error let open the application
12229,Bancomer móvil,"After I accepted the facial recognition he has let use the app, sorry. But because I must use it at work, it does not work for that, I can not even use online banking because it asks for the token every time I want to open the token in the application, it closes"
12230,Bancomer móvil,"Facial recognition was one of the reasons why I stopped using the Inbursa application therefore I stopped being a bad client Idea, I need to make an urgent transaction I can do it because I necessarily need to use the Facial Recognition"
12231,Bancomer móvil,Mandatory use of facial recognition when trying to register says an error can be passed now.
12232,Bancomer móvil,For more than believe that they do a favor for users with the facial fingerprint the only thing they do is annoy customers especially when they do not even let me register my photo after trying it more than 10 times
12233,Bancomer móvil,No bank has the right to decline the service of its clients if they refuse to give their biometric data. It should not be something forced conditional. The director of Bancomer Mexico should present his resignation. I cancel my account I uninstall the app.
12234,Bancomer móvil,"I absolutely refuse to use facial recognition. I prefer to cancel my service before I give them that information. With the information they already have, it should be enough to give me protection, there is a need to be so intrusive. This is for me benefit, but for the BBVA. I think of a bank."
12235,Bancomer móvil,"Now to enter strengths you must enter your face accept that they use them as they want? And if you accept that they use your data / facial prints, can you use the app? I prefer to use it then. It is the worst."
12236,Bancomer móvil,"Now with the facial print is a disaster, let use the app. I already have too much security on my phone to come with their inefficient methods badly echos."
12237,Bancomer móvil,"This was good a couple of years ago my cell phone is old I want to use a digital fingerprint, it is of little concern for security nobody is going to steal my brokeass."
12238,Bancomer móvil,"Regrettable that oblige the user to add the facial fingerprint, even if one agrees to register the facial fingerprint the application fails at the time of finalizing the registration."
12239,Bancomer móvil,"They did not understand the complaints regarding facial recognition. Now they make it mandatory to use the app. What are you going to do with all my information, now including my photo? The was the only BIG difference with respect to the other banks. Now I prefer to use it better to change banks. Uninstalled application."
12240,Bancomer móvil,"5 stars until the last update where the facial recognition was forced, now it is forced apart or serves to try to activate it, the worst now."
12241,Bancomer móvil,"Total crap, they force to register your face to be able to enter error mark, geniuses of developers!"
12242,Bancomer móvil,"It's good for nothing, they want to force you to give biometric personal data that I'll give you in no way, I'll have to change banks if they change this soon."
12243,Bancomer móvil,"The application is disgusting now that they got facial recognition. It forces you to give him permission to share your information, register your face, let you use the application if you do it after an hour trying to register my facial fingerprint says he manages to communicate with the servers, what stupidity!"
12244,Bancomer móvil,I can already use my electronic banking unless I send a photo of my face accept terms conditions that have to do with my privacy. YOUR COMPULSORY FACIAL RECORD IS AN AFFECTION AGAINST PRIVACY.
12245,Bancomer móvil,Facial recognition is now mandatory (why? !!) every time I try to activate it gets stuck. I can not see any data from my account !!
12246,Bancomer móvil,"Impossible to enter, and take the photo n number of times continues to fail internal error. Pesima idea."
12247,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"I really like allows keep important info pet handy phone. However, could improvements. My biggest complaint typically loads slowly mine SO's phones, sometimes I force close open work. I'll continue convenience I hope see improvements!"
12248,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"Great shot general wellness records fingertips appointment scheduling stinks. Though close 7p, I schedule appointments 7 11 am. Useless me! I go work 5a (can't drop 4:30a) get home 1 2p. From business standpoint I see much easier drop offs need flexibility too."
12249,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"Love Everything easily accessible, vaccines I got due dates are, notification appts.

Again, I called confirm appointment. So I called Banfield Animal Hospital I trying get appointment. The time I requested even open. The vet surgery time every week! I able choose time.

12254,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"basic. Can't much besides see pets, last appointment & she/where last visited. Load crap I deleting. You're much better using website."
12255,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"I really like app! Overall, useful. Any information updated hospital updated app, I keep track old baby's needs, weight, vaccines/medications given, etc. It's also handy keeping tabs things discuss vet. It could improvements, adding option cancel change appointments instead 'requesting appointment' access know dates times actually available. I time though, I highly recommend anyone Banfield family."
12256,Banfield Pet Health Tracker,"I made account get let log in. I know I getting password login wrong. But since cant recognize login I JUST made. It kicked says I call customer support. No email respond help. Plus, I called closed weekends. So I wait two days get help dumb app. This dumb."

12485,BankMobile Vibe App,It's great great bank.
12487,Banorte Movil,"This excellent Digital Card, ideal for online payments. The payment with a single card should last longer since 3 times are enough to enter the data. It would be great if you add features like HSBC Total Control."
12488,Banorte Movil,"Horrible app. Notifications work 10 days a month, then ask for an update. For two months I can make bank transfers it takes a long time to start validating the user password."
12489,Banorte Movil,"It works very well with the exception of anything that has to do with the camera. It always comes out blurred, you can zoom in, read the barcodes, take the picture when you tap the screen (as it says in the instructions)."
12490,Banorte Movil,"To review the charges generated with the credit card is excellent, however if you want to review your movements with the debit card all movements made appear."
12492,Banorte Movil,"With its last update of the red icon it scans the qr codes for Transfer, the section of my qr code does not appear either. I hope it works again since it is very useful"
12493,Banorte Movil,You need features save cards which you do transfer frequently to avoid putting data every time
12494,Banorte Movil,"I think good enough I Bancomer also way easier spei efficient one, take lot it'll help tu improve thank it, good I said"
12495,Banorte Movil,It has a horrible bug that lets you write when entering the initial data. Repeat the syllables after it closes. Fix it please!
12496,Banorte Movil,"It is the best bank, I have other banks are compared, you have all the hand, from token to fast transfers without registering the account previously"
12497,Banorte Movil,"Update 2018: have improved considerably, although their mysterious parameter updates are still somewhat latose."
12498,Banorte Movil,"Yooo! This sucks, 2 weeks requires update, gets frozen let u log in. U end deleting reinstalling every couple weeks. It really sucks"
12499,Banorte Movil,"When you are in the middle of a transaction, a window appears asking you to rate it then you can finish the transaction, it is a very annoying usability error."
12502,Banorte Movil,"One of the best bank applications. Well organized, simple, it has all the common operations. The notifications are very detailed instantaneous, it is possible to withdraw from an account without a card."
12503,Banorte Movil,"It is good compared to other banks. However, there is a lack of work in fluency."
12504,Banorte Movil,"The ask much rated, annoying. Also annoying many updates data base."
12506,Banorte Movil,"The most important thing is that it has excellent facial recognition but I hate having to put the account data every time I want to transfer, in addition to the 1000 transfer limit I think."
12507,Banorte Movil,"The is excellent, but, I lost my plastic leaves without card because the plastic is discharged, then what is the point of removing without a card if you must have the plastic available?"
12511,Banorte Movil,Improve facial recognition A825 - Allow frequent reliable operations; Periodic operations and income every time the same data; Separate by type of operation. Greetings P. Colonel
12514,Banorte Movil,"You need to be sensitive, you put a transfer option in each account, but when you select it, always put the first account you think you will put the account from where you launch the transfer"
12515,Banorte Movil,"It was very good, but they have already totally disappointed, slow everything, transfers take sometimes until noon, fix this, just because it is my bank where they deposit from work I want to make portability of payroll if it takes a day more, very bad ..."
12516,Banorte Movil,"It is a bank application that we say meets its objective. It is possible to make transfers, pay cards but it ends up convincing. It is very difficult to register a new account from the application. Notifications take years to open. It seems to me that they can improve the performance of the application."
12518,Banorte Movil,"Excellent for me ... You only need to limit access to messages (notifications). ANY, without the need to enter a password, you can know subscription charges."
12520,Banorte Movil,Easy to use very complete ... Although you can register for frequent transfers from here. That would be an excellent upgrade.
12523,Banorte Movil,Very good! Since it allows to do many operations without having to cash my card the hand.
12525,Banorte Movil,Already let in. According to this the user is wrong but it is the case. On the page entered without problem.
12526,Banorte Movil,"He did not like it at all. You have to type the password too many times. The transfer limit is very little can be increased. I did not find the option to save accounts for frequent transfer, I can copy the card number. Is slow. You have the minimum you expected: check balances, make transfers"
12527,Banque Populaire,For a while now I just can not access my account. It blocks during loading and nothing happens. I can not check my money in and out which really starts to exasperate me! Do something !!!
12528,Banque Populaire,Great app!
12529,Banque Populaire,A historical section of the samples received is missing
12531,Banque Populaire,"It is unacceptable to push notifications to advertise to win vouchers or whatever (world cup where not), I point this out because it uses the notifications to advertise and it does not it is not possible to disable it."
12532,Banque Populaire,"Constantly work. After I enter password fingerprint keeps loading never opens account. I restart app, clear cache, restart phone, reinstall still keeps happening. I manage sign 1 10 attempts. Very poor!"
12533,Banque Populaire,Practical and intuitive
12536,Banque Populaire,"Since the last update, nothing works! All config been reset, fast account consultation is disabled at each connection, validation fingerprint no longer works ... It's a shame!"
12537,Banque Populaire,It work Moto z Android 7.1
12538,Banque Populaire,Application too heavy and outdated.
12542,Banque Populaire,"Track your accounts and make immediate transfers. But impossible to make deferred transfers, to delete transfers, to extract his writings in csv etc. In short, the minimum."
12543,Banque Populaire,"New version much less intuitive, no colors, really a bad update"
12547,Banque Populaire,The application does not stop to stop since the last
12548,Banque Populaire,Very useful I can not live without
12555,Banque Populaire,Worse bank.
12560,Banque Populaire,"Do not work I get very well connected to a web browser, but not at all on the application"
12563,Banque Populaire,I can not connect to the app since the last update. Problem with username and password The combination of the 2 works well on the website.
12565,Banque Populaire,Non-functional Not functional
12566,Banque Populaire,"Bug and synchronization ?? 3 to 4 days for this update, while on other bank 1o min ready is updated, for example a purchase. Bug at the first connection that crash! Disappointed ...."

12847,Baseball Boy!,Too many ads. lucky hit ball twice ad plays may get x get sometimes watching it. And ad bar right next main UI element aka hit button. Much better better looking playing games little ads unless choose watch benefits.
12848,Baseball Boy!,Good game good time killer..WAY TOO MANY ADS... Are serious? Remove 90% ads would bareable. I understand ads pays free us he'll let breathe. I'm closing ads I'm playing game. I seen developer respond yet. Wonder why? Developer please make update less ads.
12849,Baseball Boy!,It would fun could actually find free game waste battery ads. You get hit 30 second ad. Pretty sad I sit phone go get drink still wait ads stop.
12850,Baseball Boy!,Guys yes may ads play line get ANY ads all. Any way I like game lot. Kills time literally FISH bat. XD I think try game see yourself. Don't forget line thing.
12851,Baseball Boy!,I support adds 90% time spent adds. This given hit back button 7 times every hit. 30 hits 30 min 700 back buttons. Bad marketing. Hope got million quit creative
12852,Baseball Boy!,"The game simple satisfying, incremental game enjoy. But theres many ads. One permanently bottom screen AND forced complete shot. Recommended turn internet connection whilst playing, nuisance."
12853,Baseball Boy!,"Love concept, ad every hit. Once hit, get option double money watching ad. I decline still gets watch f'ing ad. Controls hit ball jittery best. Once get around level 30, basically hitting ball, watching city disappear eliminating chance skill used. On second thought, I really like game all. Do favor waste time it."
12854,Baseball Boy!,"BS game ads. No matter many times try shut still come back. Even using airplane mode. You never get perfect shot bc every time get dead center target, put ad. The time dont get ads try watch ad free game items. Deleting review."
12855,Baseball Boy!,Its actually embarrassing hard game shoves ads throat. It's even good game throwing ads left right center. It asks want watch video double money still get video ad soon get ready next turn. The developer shame.
12856,Baseball Boy!,"Love game need different scenery. As progress level ball goes high even regular scenery disappears. Way many ads yes I could pay 2.99 get rid I'm stingy like that, continue complaining. Far many ads!!"
12857,Baseball Boy!,"If like ads game you! Ads every hit! Not simple ads either, I talking 2-3 minute ads let of. Its almost like watching 10 hour YouTube video ads."
12858,Baseball Boy!,"I started liking game lot! But, man alive. You play game 10 seconds, 30 second ad comes up. Too many ads. I'm deleting this. It's waste time anyway"
12859,Baseball Boy!,"Ad...ad...ad, killed game adverts, great concept. No need many adverts they've got permanent ad screen times well video every turn. Money grabbing ruined game"
12860,Baseball Boy!,"TURN OFF YOUR WIFI AND DATA . 0 ADS WHILE PLAYING STRAIGHT TO NEXT SHOT. I'm okay ads, lets free maybe could reduce like every 3-5 shots? Also asks, watch ad double coins? If say shows ad anyway. Also aim game stop pointer middle maximum power distance. However ALL towns middle. So 'good' shot hit middle hit building actually take less distance low power side free run buildings. You need move towns dead centre allow us aim left rightthat way makes bit interesting straight constantly"
12861,Baseball Boy!,"There far many ads, every 2 hits. It also keeps crashing I hit 5 6 times. It runs badly lags much. If fix I install give higher rating 1 star uninstalling"
12862,Baseball Boy!,This terrible. There way many ads. I understand ads free game. But 90 percent using cancelling add. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS!!
12863,Baseball Boy!,If like watching 26 second commercials every time hit ball game you. At first I don't mind watching I know pays developers. But request private data email access. The commercials get worse.
12864,Baseball Boy!,"Lame. The game fun day two. After upgrading easily achieving bats 2 days, game extremely redundant boring. The scenery change, super bounce near impossible first attempt ball going insanely fast. If get 'perfect' hit (which goal playing game while) ball stay middle. Probability crushing cars impossible gets point."
12865,Baseball Boy!,"Fun game constant ads make game real challenge enjoy long term. 1 shot last 20 seconds, wait 30 seconds ad finish ridiculous. Also, level 12 skills went back zero, making next level absolutely impossible."
12866,Baseball Boy!,Horrible since update. Game sped work properly. Trying tap bounce almost impossible. Please fix enjoyable. Also amount ads ad increased every swing good
12867,Baseball Boy!,"Fun play, gets competitive BUT ENTIRELY WAY TO MANY ADDS! I mean ad every single pitch? Yeah that's bit much! Come know better that! Unless want people coming back play game. People get sick ads delete game."
12868,Baseball Boy!,"TOO MANY ADS!!! Lovely little game, advert every shot gets old fast. You get option doubling earnings shot, watching ad. But decline HAVE TO WATCH AN AD ANYWAY. I understand need earn revenue. But instead earning revenue actually playing game, going earn nothing, I'm uninstalling. Greedy devs"
12869,Baseball Boy!,"This advert delivery system game attached, pleasing graphics simple gameplay. You get bored, always look advert bottom screen, breaks 30 seconds different adverts shown swings. Two thumbs adverts."
12870,Baseball Boy!,"Wondered got 3.4 rating cause looked fun. After playing little bit I realized why. Haven't looked reviews yet I already know everyone complaining there's ""too many ads."" How hard fix game much enjoyable..?"
12871,Baseball Boy!,Easy fun. Has ad keeps popping says select stop seeing add selecting brings sales site ad. I think misleading
12872,Baseball Boy!,Way way way many ads...takes away game play. When actually play game pretty fun. But ads almost every turn kills
12873,Baseball Boy!,I paid get ad version. Took 1 star since perfect fire ball blow cars buildings trees. Let's make happen development team.
12874,Baseball Boy!,"Too many ads. And I went play today, said videos available, I get double offline points, videos working fine I actually started playing game. Kinda sketchy..."
12875,Baseball Boy!,"I know I'm still playing game. I passed level 70... getting little old. But satisfying still. Is probably best offline coins earn small amount. Otherwise, I'd probably play less. Dunno. Update refine please!"
12876,Baseball Boy!,It would better would less ads. Literally every 2 hits there's ad freaking annoying
12877,Baseball Boy!,"Been playing 5-10 minutes comments speaking truth. Way many ads, seriously annoying. They selfish earn money put ad everywhere, say collect double u got still plays video cNt exit lets you. If many ads it'd better I hate this, dislike, hate. I wonder workers even read these? Pathetic"
12878,Baseball Boy!,It's shame I liked game. To start many adds game progresses glitches get worse point skill timing longer factor. becomes increasingly impossible stop arrow red power arrow delayed press stop it.
12879,Baseball Boy!,Want constant ads make money frustration game. Otherwise dont even bother.
12880,Baseball Boy!,"Shady shady, weird EULAs popping game play, allowed x2 videos, mention WORST thing make perfect shot. Make perfect shot, ball cross requirement boinch bake 4000m"
12881,Baseball Boy!,You get ad every 20 seconds. Beyond annoying. Gameplay would ok advertisements glitch game out.
12882,Baseball Boy!,"Aside loads ads, hitting perfects actually useless. Which kind frustrating seems like goal. Yet end hitting building post losing distance. It's weirdly better aim diagonally.. Still play though, still fun."
12883,Baseball Boy!,It crushed 4 days I start square one. Everything 20 strength speed bounce nice game keep busy although still little freezes starts
12884,Baseball Boy!,"Ads time waste memory phone, beware every bat ad, unless course pay. No thank that's games like clash clans popular maybe company get lessons"
12885,Baseball Boy!,"Turn mobile data. Then play uninterrupted. If leave mobile data on, gets really annoying watching ads time. You watch ads play game. It's fun game requires skill. Good time passing game."
12886,Baseball Boy!,"Latest updates poo.. a, sound automatically reagrdless turned off. As soon open app, sound.. kinda annoying b, next upgrade 52390500(struggle make 1.2 million) c, ball drops bounces spot pointless..d, bats yet get new ball need unlock bats. need fix lose lot players"

12927,Basketball Stars,"Awesome game problem ads constantly stop working. Wait 24 hours watch adds collect money,a bag brick gold ads stop working says collected already. Other awesome game love it. Plenty options real fun play frien... Full Review"
12928,Basketball Stars,"It's good game. HOWEVER, connection inconsistent. Even I'm next router best connection ever, still messes makes loading next shot take ages. I get 3 6 points every time lag next shot messes whole game. It may impatient, time still taken away I wait opponent comes back 15 point deficit 5 seconds."
12929,Basketball Stars,"Every single time shootout games let's oponent Challenger shoot Bell stops so. The oponent last chance score ahead close game usually do. Also match unevenly. If leval 10 may put leval 21 26 even higher. How even remotely fair. This huge cheating scam get spend real money thier ""free"" game. This company sucks big one."

12931,Basketball Stars,I love hate it..... need time less time finish game see person skills really sucks man way timing shot shot awkward's back board keeps moving
12932,Basketball Stars,"Solid game aware going run tough competition, ""pay win"" part. I'd give solid 5 stars except aspect. With said, I completely addicted I'm enjoying game."
12934,Basketball Stars,"Blocked opponents shot clutch game. The game gave 3 points I lost game. 5/5 game design. Work servers, servers incredibly glitchy unpredictable. One moment beat guy blocking shot."
12935,Basketball Stars,"I downloaded game I love basketball. I played basketball (Highschool), I still play basketball. My son 15 I taught play 2 1/2 yrs old. He'd play shoulders. I created basketball addict. I've Celtics fan whole life son carries love. We games matter simple always teach lesson. This game teaches patience timing everything. I think game could something. For example It ask favorite team beginning drafted team, (while getting pointers fave teams star(s), In case, Celtics pissibly Kyrie Irving) however would need get ?? level 25?? access buying official (NBA gear name voice number jersey, Celtics case). Then would need complete many missions order get annual salary, sign longer contracts, choose traded, etc...Just thought (feel free idea(s) copyrighted registered). However game still addictive, fun, passes time quickly. Great Job."
12936,Basketball Stars,Waiting 3 hours bag open.. Or 7 hours better killing game. Run energy fast career mode also sucks takes way long recharge. I really like game though really great.
12937,Basketball Stars,I rage sometimes. Why? Because always get played person thats like 9 levels can't even win. Its fair fun:(
12938,Basketball Stars,"The Game excellent. Except errors game. But Annoying thing videos, open 3 videos within time, 2 days 'No videos avable'."

13068,Battlelands Royale,"Very addicting, fun. problem though, I'm tight space, like zone small duos, I can't shoot opponent instead bullets go teammate fly I end losing that. If could fix greatly appreciated I rate 5 stars fix"
13069,Battlelands Royale,"It's clear majority game composed various aspects ripped directly Fortnite Pubg (I mean look friggin' logo Christ's sakes). It's shame chose route could throw something together quickly possible using popular battle royale games essentially copy from, instead kind originality. That aside, entertaining decent time killer, nonetheless."
13072,Battlelands Royale,"This great game... good graphics, control. This game fun... But Playing without getting kind reward give us feel accomplishment... In game fill experience bar level get rewards... It's give reward kills... also level based reward system give us reward without us Battle Pass... So I'd like company seriously consider problem... Otherwise good game potential..."
13073,Battlelands Royale,This game honestly awesome! I play gf time sister bf play together well! I Would definitely recommend anyone looking fun game! The thing would like say really hope developers keep updating game! There's many games update make better! 4 stars
13074,Battlelands Royale,"An amazing game nice cartoon graphics. However, copy battle royale game fortnite noticable, however makes difference game play all! This best Battle royale app, we're around 30 plays going head head solo, buddy duo (where add friend) random duo."
13075,Battlelands Royale,"This exactly I looking for. Something fun. Not challenging fair. Only thing I would like see teammate id add friends. that, I enjoying game matter like pubg fortnite, fun either way, skills everyone level."
13076,Battlelands Royale,"Great game, addicting! Nice touch battle royal mobile! Only thing I think needs added ability gun automatically equip it. When heavy battle waiting equip work. It still equip option standing confirm want gun really need gun equip. Keeping health shield wait maybe lower wait time bit?"
13077,Battlelands Royale,I love game! It's fast paced zone moves quickly really fun! Only problem can't get battle pass free pas tout pay even level 100 explosion bazooka/RPG op
13078,Battlelands Royale,"The idea good. The theam looks like fortnight. Cute battle royal game small (under 200mb) packge. But game devolopers make hard level earn gold buy stuff.forceing us buy things real money microtransaction. .game devolopers. If read plz make reasonable. Plz make rewarding little bit more.lower cost gold coins shop. And add MORE WEPONS, BOMBS,TRAPS, HOLOGRAME DECOY DEVISES, TELEPORTATION DEVISES. importantly "" diveroll"" make option jump away incoming attakes.like type games. And pleeeez ask give us gold coin match.i waiting update. Thank"
13080,Battlelands Royale,"The game lot potential mobile game developers created money grabber/cash cow attempting utilize success fortnite advantage. Fortnite listens players, game even make possible obtain battle pass grinding/free players."
13082,Battlelands Royale,"LOTS OF ROOM TO IMPROVE! First off, beautiful game. Simple concept, great product concurrent social demand battle royale themed games! However, balance weapons bit off. Shotguns bit strong regards power range. If I'm getting 6 9 damage rifle max range, shotgun popping back 25 30 damage. All all, game pretty great. I love pace play. I see guns eventually come, I see opportunity fix balancing issues. Thanks taking time create product, I hope see game grow soon!"
13083,Battlelands Royale,"Instantly addictive. Unlike others mobile battle royals, game try first person shooter limited mobile controls. The top view perfect. Anyone play enjoy game. This game deserves several million downloads million downloads barely wait trying get match. This perfect mobile battle royal."
13085,Battlelands Royale,"I like it, good alternative Fortnite users. But, can't tell difference small med kits big ones (same shields) unless side side. Battle Pass costs much. Lower price."
13086,Battlelands Royale,Great game overall prizes get leveling great unless pay battle pass. Difficult earn money difficult add people unless know ID (which show). It's good fun great way pass time. Fornite PUBG way better though.
13087,Battlelands Royale,"I know I gave 3 stars, I still would recommend it. Good mobile game. A bite size battle royale. The 2 main issues I playing friends balancing issues. I tried playing friend always said offline, even playing room. Also, lot game comes hp. And fact stand health packs battle gain hp help win fight. But runs seamlessly fun game play waiting appointment little bit free time. Reminder:JUST BECAUSE I GAVE IT 3 STARS THAT DOES NOT MEAN I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. BECAUSE I DO."
13088,Battlelands Royale,The game awesome problem 1.the map small 2. It good weapon inventory 3. It nice voice chat 4. much weapons game 5.its hard get money gold game hope guys something game good really good
13089,Battlelands Royale,"Best battle royal game play store moment. clean crisp game cost money free. havnt encountered add either. subtracted star isnt perfect game. gotta say, almoat there. lacking something cant put finger it. good game valued 4 stars moment. Pros *Clean Crisp *Simple *Challenging *Competetive *doesn't lag *real players Cons *Small Game *Lacking Maps *Only Couple Game Modes *No Communication players"
13090,Battlelands Royale,"This far favourite games android! It close 5* game couple flaws! Improve buddy system, add new maps, reward system feels extremely weak, I played free felt little reward time put in. I bought battle pass feel either case much return playing game. It also feels like going get really expensive time, I buying does! The gameplay, graphics enjoyment reward players better!"
13092,Battlelands Royale,"The game fun, improvements. I like I dont get experience Kills. I get 7 8 kills match lose someone camping. Also, leaderboards. Leaderboards That viewed categories using stats. Keepimg working game. I play everyday."
13093,Battlelands Royale,"This game rip Fortnite PUBG EXP system rigged, I 3 kills get 5 EXP get rewards level instead every battle. That aside I would love thank creators game fix last touchscreen PLS, really great game."
13094,Battlelands Royale,Such amazing game! The graphics gameplay great! I love different types guns unique way! I tried buy coins battle pass error. It ok I got refund. Overall great game I absolutely recommend it!
13095,Battlelands Royale,I really enjoy game!!! It's lots fun graphics fun!!! Saying things changed...first add guns!!!!! There's lot guns would fun more!!!! This game also easier leveling system!!!! I many games killed many opponents I'm still level 15!!!! One important add free customizations!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!! I DONT NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS ONE!!!! Optional things would definitely make game better!!! When hide behind trees buildings show shadow make hiding place like bushes. Make places go inside would also cool!!! Also!!!!! Please add map!!! The map small!!! This big deal make control parachute!!! Other things game great!!!
13096,Battlelands Royale,"Add guns, please put effort securing servers. A lot times lag unbearable. Stop trying money grab though. Because people like game spend money it. So dedicate time listening fanbase perfecting game alright. Dont copy unique."
13097,Battlelands Royale,I feel like damage consistency little off. Also would like sensitivity option. That would help alot people shake bit playing. Overall go mobile BR small adjustments I'm sure everyone play this. Small tweaks combat stuff.
13098,Battlelands Royale,"Can add easier way unlock Battle Pass like coin rewards Free Pass daily rewards tab. The Daily rewards go Day 7 login every day Day 7 unlock coins new skin. Just add new way achieve coins. Otherwise, game amazing."
13099,Battlelands Royale,This game poorly balanced. You hold 1 gun. Shotgun weapon really matters. On duos land teamate function. Too little guns. No vehicle speed boost. Cant medkit u decent inventory. No way escape battle. Unless ypu fix problems immediately thus game near unplayable.
13100,Battlelands Royale,"The games actually really fun art style adorable! However, O think wider variety guns game. I another thing I wanted say I remember. Oh well.. game overall addictive I really like it."
13101,Battlelands Royale,"Despite fact game direct RIP fortnite, works well mobile substitute. The thing I problem power weapons. The shotgun ridiculously broken ar sniper insanely weak comparison. I know I something wrong, I hit 35 damage shotgun shot somebody, ar I 7 damage per shot much range fire rate shotgun. Now, I want guns overpowered come on, ridiculous."
13102,Battlelands Royale,"This amazing game requests. You add guns. Such mp5, ak 47, double barren shot gun. Also, pistol kind would nice. You add mire ammo bazooka damage ar 10. This game would amazing added. Thank you."
13103,Battlelands Royale,There convenient way add friends makes community building aspect difficult takes away enjoyment game. Also clear rather paying players vs. Nonpayment almost gear free players kinda sad. I love graphics overall fun game adjustments needed perhaps content differing battle modes....food thought.
13104,Battlelands Royale,This game pretty good I 3 friends play game I want play once. I able allowed duos. Also money much £12 1500 battle bucks. That quite ridiculous. Please lower price help lot people.
13105,Battlelands Royale,Can even get battle pass used real money gold. Why fist must better shotgun? You need skill win need auto gun full hp shild all.
13106,Battlelands Royale,Not bad game. But 1 star battle pass totally jacked. Free play players get almost nothing. Battle pass purchasers get something every level. Ridiculous. I'm spending 14 dollars shallow game. Y'all damn minds.
13107,Battlelands Royale,The touch screen joystick worst idea...sometimes lag. Why launch pc version atleast? You made love game made get sucking experience able control character gameplay properly. :( Please launch pc version
13108,Battlelands Royale,"I think game amazing addictive. My complaint weapon obtaining system, stand still couple seconds. It's big deal, I hope changed future."
13109,Battlelands Royale,This game getting boring minute. I mean play like without getting reward. There rewards every kill. But hea matter haw many kill get nothing.
13110,Battlelands Royale,"This game addictive things changed made better, as: More Weapons Rarities guns make Battle pass days longer And also Make map bigger lots different biomes I absolutely love game like fortnite really cool cartoon version. Oh yeah thing improve Rarities skins add skins onto battle pass put things onto item shop. Thank You making game I hope come really successful game☺☺☺"
13111,Battlelands Royale,"I like game. It's exactly like Fortnite (which games try be) addictive. My two complaints 1. The controls need less sensitivity 2. I hate item shop battle pass items. The battle pass says items ""exclusive"" true."
13113,Battlelands Royale,"Great game; fast paced, fun, easy learn! My problem game mentioned could hold gun time. Took games realise it. Other wise amazing game guys!"
13114,Battlelands Royale,"Easy game. The experience earned match pathetic though. I like system leveling up. Don't care earning items considering free version I play xp earned isnt even effected damage kills, placement. This game well making worth free version."
13115,Battlelands Royale,"Cheating problem seems fixed.... experiance system... top 3 ever get 20, 30, 50 exp. If first die, get 5exp reguardless... match take 10 mins fully complete. If bad player litterally jump match, die first, load another repeat 10 mins. Its possible net 25 30 exp way every 10 mins guaranteed. The reason ypu ive spent almost 8 mins match killed 5 ppl died pnly get 12exp I could gotten 15 20...."
13116,Battlelands Royale,"1. You get 5 10 ammo added additional gun pick gun equipped with. 2. Hand hand combat WEAKEST attack, strongest."
13117,Battlelands Royale,"Honestly, people criticise game enough weapons copy pubg fortnite. This game perfect way is. The problem I would game battle pass costs much I would definitely recommend game."
13118,Battlelands Royale,"This game perfect small, fun battleroyale game play store. However though game amazing definitely lacks key features. Some key features I'm talking balance weapon damage. The damage overall good lacks balancement. Another key feature I found report button. This I'm seeing key players end game kills. Other 2 things I mentioned, I'm sold game. There pretty expensive purchases get coin able spend battlepass necessary part game. Hope devs see helps persuade users play"
13119,Battlelands Royale,"This really cool game kinda like fortnite/Pub I think everyone chance level get money time I started I realised can't get battle pass I want wait long, others hand really cool game! Keep"
13120,Battlelands Royale,"The explosion radius missile launcher needs reduced, since literally shots. People without battle passes need rewards, like dances emotes. Longer game mode would fun too."
13121,Battlelands Royale,"This game could alot better. The damage guns atrocious, basically impossible kill someone. Please buff guns, ill give game 5 star rating."
13122,Battlelands Royale,"I LOVE app, change I think need make xp, I 17 kill game got 8th place received 12 xp, I got 0 kills 8th place. It place based, kills give bonus xp. Which reason I probably going buy battle pass"
13123,Battlelands Royale,3 things need change. 1. Remove bush things make invisible. 2. If object character enemy able see them. And 3. Take trees replace crates cover. Cool concept tho
13124,Battlelands Royale,"Costs 6$ want ever unlock cosmetics, I hate. On flip side, pay win. Simple, solid game. Only map. Map always shrinks roughly spot. Doesn't much data lag."
13126,Battlelands Royale,"It's fun but.. Is even inventory system? Also, I really like top-down view, I honestly thought gameplay would similar Call Mini series, mostly perspective."
13127,Battlelands Royale,Awesome game. One button shooting. As option. Instead direction shooting. One button would good alternative. You already move direction. After getting level 6 see earning pass would take days upon days without paying. The ones gullable. I delete.
13128,Battlelands Royale,"Uhh..The game great ate shooting gun weird. Also free pass awful. 50 coins , 1 parachute, useless emote two skins simple. But anyways gameplay awesome."
13130,Battlelands Royale,"This game best battle royale games market. It simple controls,great graphics, gameplay fun engaging. The third person perspective is, opinion, better phones first. Great job!"
13131,Battlelands Royale,I'm giving 3 stars 1. When u shoot sometimes kills u ur target time I hate 2. Can u add power ups? And 3. STOP COPYING FORTNITE
13132,Battlelands Royale,Do touch game especially kid phone - drain bank account. They know exactly targeting strategy beneath contempt.
13133,Battlelands Royale,"Great game. But needs lot improvements. First all, sniper rifle needs deal WAY damage. And bring prices otherwise free players (like me) cant get battle pass."
13134,Battlelands Royale,The major issue much lag comes play. I've enemy die continue shoot killed went screen. They also need fix solo teaming. Almost every 3rd game I play I see players teaming.
13135,Battlelands Royale,I love game. The thing spend money gane impossible battle pass. And reward bad. I love game. But need make free play
13136,Battlelands Royale,"This game sucks. When fight gun near by, pick worse gun end dying. Super frustrating. Also hand stronger gun game"
13137,Battlelands Royale,The game f-ing suck... It stupid. Even full health 1 shut sniper dead
13138,Battlelands Royale,It's good quick battle royale game live duo play available battle pass available paying players. It costs 560 total rewards free players add 200. TLDR: Free players never get battle pass rewards.
13139,Battlelands Royale,OMG I LOVE THIS GAME! It fun addicting graphics good game play. Needs guns tho thing needs. WOW best games played awhile
13140,Battlelands Royale,"I loved app, copy real fortnite. If could make update squad someday I would really appreciate it. Also could try add building breaking trees, rocks would really helpful"
13141,Battlelands Royale,It shows friend active is...it makes sense. And plus shields either need increased number per round. Or needs give shield
13143,Battlelands Royale,This game opinion bad. battle pass expensive. u dont even get enough get close. 6 guns....6. view choice 3rd person birds eye view.
13145,Battlelands Royale,It's good game. But I 2 problems it. 1. The storm comes 5 seconds. And 2. The ak47 literally 6 damage fire rate low. Plz make better increase time run storm
13146,Battlelands Royale,"Overall, fun wee game play. Only thing miss graphics options. I older phone struggles sometimes. Being able manually drop settings might help"
13147,Battlelands Royale,Great gameplay smooth controls great graphics. I hate I suck much can't get past two kills I top 30. I'll keep though. Just something I rage quit every then.
13148,Battlelands Royale,Great game especially fortnite. PLS add squads. It would much better game squads. Another thing pls either make easier get battle pass easier get Battle bus. I'm sort person would spend money games know people feel same.
13149,Battlelands Royale,Only map large enough variety would nice. Going levels incredibly unrewarding unless pay season pass. This feels like beta version due lack content.
13150,Battlelands Royale,Really amazing game couple things still missing. Adding squad mode would awesome! Also make get kills get game rank come. Leveling playing games difficult tedious task.
13151,Battlelands Royale,Best mobile game I ever played life I'm addicted I can't stop playing. It's fun I hope day maybe devs hook maybe couple battle bucks.
13152,Battlelands Royale,"Too laggy. Especially combat really dont need laggy. Also able switch guns would nice. Could fun game, fix lag"
13153,Battlelands Royale,I downloaded game really fun game. But I problem. I trying play friend I sent friend request. He accepted always showing offline even though sitting beside game open. I cannot play him. Please fix ASAP!!!!
13154,Battlelands Royale,"Great game actually, thing missing, MOTIVATION. Cmon devs. Give us items free acc. Sooner later people get bored limited gifts give. Hehe. That's"
13155,Battlelands Royale,First thing I trying send request sister I never received tried never worked. Second I wish thier squad 50v50 please fix add I would give five stars thank
13156,Battlelands Royale,"Great game, real problem hacks. In solo, often winner 6 games played 4 wins. We remember kid used circle, circle, circle, square, triangle, circle first go game? Well kids playing Unfortunately."
13157,Battlelands Royale,It fun fortnite copy version Android. I personally think sad I can't get buddies says request sent I'll never received one. Pls fix
13158,Battlelands Royale,Levelling takes soo long.. bought pass.. But guys like fortnite? No need challenges give people bought pass xp boost.. I know something like 20 xp every match played.. kills too.. every kill 5-10 xp.. every match 7-8 kills die final fight dont close range weapons ammo.. please 2 weapons difderent category... So skill based lucky..
13159,Battlelands Royale,playing phone cause game keep saying connection error tablet. even full bars still love game though
13160,Battlelands Royale,"A blatent cash grab popular BR style game mode featured Fortnite Player Unknowns Battlegrounds. While top-down design ads twist something fresh scene. It's clear art design taking existing styles, outfits gamble deceive uneducated users games made genre explode. The font ripped Epic Games Fortnite, casual attire male model taken Player Unknowns Battlegrounds. The efforts make something unique ruined tarnished cheap tricks offers interesting story outside gameplay. Overall, worth time."
13161,Battlelands Royale,Can't get Battle Pass without spending real world money. This makes game annoying. There ways earning coins getting Battle Pass free.
13162,Battlelands Royale,"This game excellent mechanics, little bugs, nice graphics, outstanding battle pass! My problem price battle pass. It seems bit over-priced .moment"
13163,Battlelands Royale,"BATTLELANDS ROYALE- Cashing Fortnite PUBG franchises great effect. This addictive game hook keeps wanting more. Good social media influences amazing UI. Graphics PRO quality game environment drags another world. Plenty unlockables good currency (IAC). Ad content forced, yet seek it. Beware- game keep night. Check full review YT channel."
13164,Battlelands Royale,"Need Improvement:- 1- Need skills like double kill, double run, invisible, EMP, Auto Target etc. 2- Need Leaderboard 3- Need clan & war 4- Need weapon update. 5- Need different areas"
13165,Battlelands Royale,Improve weapon damage range. Atleast sniper much range sight. The assault rifle retarded af.
13166,Battlelands Royale,Great little game. Only criticism would difficult earn fun custom stuff without paying lot money buy battle pass. And £6 lot type game (fortnite cheaper).

13387,Beautiful Widgets Free,"Weather Won't Update Worked fine multiple phones years. Got Galaxy S7, weather update. Also, clock stuck wrong time zone. Tried everything I could think get working. Very disappointed."
13388,Beautiful Widgets Free,Upgraded paid version 24 hours ago yet recd update. Money deducted google account yet I getting nothing! Hope scam. Hopefully developer read post (if ) contact rectify problems me.
13389,Beautiful Widgets Free,Somehow I accidently removed clock homescreen.. Which big deal easy fix. When I went put back homescreen longer fit way I tried kinds different options. Going find another app.
13390,Beautiful Widgets Free,Too many permissions needed. Really poor privacy. I fail see need clock widget access call WiFi info. Wouldn't access photo gallery sufficient? The device maintains connectivity need know I active call whom? There less intrusive provide clock widget features.
13391,Beautiful Widgets Free,Lost locations again! I used last 4 phones. The ways wants upgrade order get weather work. I already upgraded pro? Disappointed sure changing
13392,Beautiful Widgets Free,"I told another would make weather display work Trek Lcars display It apply widget. It keeps saying apply widget first, even though I am."
13393,Beautiful Widgets Free,I bought The pro version wants BW+! THATS NOT RIGHT AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED THE BUG OF PRE-ANIMATION ON HOME SCREEN IT ACTIVATES EVERY TIME I TURN ON PHONE GO BACK TO HOME SCREEN. THIS BUG HAS BEEN THERE FOR OVER 2 years matter phone I use. Poor poor maitainance.
13394,Beautiful Widgets Free,Widgets stop updating It would great except widgets freeze stop updating nexus 6. I task managers battery saver installed like developer cautions able fix it. Stops working randomly several times day reboot seems fix it...at least little while.
13395,Beautiful Widgets Free,Bad publicity This freemium app. To add locations/cities pay. However listed free. Anyway developer getting enough bad reviews behavior. It pity since used good app.
13396,Beautiful Widgets Free,"It let add widgets without enabling access device location. And cannot enter location manually without paying. So completely useless, unless let spy you."
13397,Beautiful Widgets Free,"Don't waste time...uninstalling today....Horrible UI widgets terrible. I'm leave bad reviews.... require someone upgrade order simply change background widget that, mind you, already looks designed design beginners training class kindergarten kids, beyond ludicrous."
13398,Beautiful Widgets Free,Not sure happened All sudden clock stopped working completely...went get new widget comes invisible ghost. Now I can't get crappy huge white ones customs even work. Might uninstall

13406,Beautiful Widgets Free,"My All-time favorite weather/clock app! The. Live HD weather icons frosted glass / semi transparent panels creates Kool & Clean rich looking weather clock, try neon green blue L E D number style. It hard resist staring"
13407,Beautiful Widgets Free,"cannot tell time correctly I like depth able customize widgets cannot seem tell time, consistently claims hour later actually is. I uninstalled reinstalled hopes would fix problem didn't. The setting manually set time. I recommend based hokey performance. Official uninstall stupid bug fixed. This used work properly. Idk changed did. 0★'S."
13408,Beautiful Widgets Free,"Typical Its typical day time companies get used something suddenly make pay years (alternate location feature). Youre making money ads, facebook fine way. I put ads free version. Dont greedy make view ads pay. Switching weather channel."
13409,Beautiful Widgets Free,"pulls money account give product!!! I paid $1.79 able additional features, pulled bank account says error!!! either give money back give I paid for!!!"

I emailed developer got NO RESPONSE!! Do waste time think enough client's get back something I sure simple fix end! Unacceptable!

16247,Blood Donor,Great app. Make everything easy scheduling appointments even completing rapid pass right there. You also keep donations appointments. I love
16248,Blood Donor,Only quibble blood tracker always seem work. It also seem track platelet donations.
16249,Blood Donor,Worst ever. When I try make appt says none available I go red cross plenty available blood drives.
16250,Blood Donor,"Update makes work again! Great scheduling appointments, signing drive, rapid pass."
16251,Blood Donor,"Tons helpful info, easy navigate. Love tracks everything you. So convenient!"
16252,Blood Donor,"These Indian's, made US users."
16253,Blood Donor,"Great people, great experience. Hope Glendora Community Hospital, Glendora CA bloodmobile often."
16254,Blood Donor,"The user friendly, laid well."
16255,Blood Donor,I like easy manage
16256,Blood Donor,Donate blood save life
16257,Blood Donor,Soooo convenient.
16258,Blood Donor,This latest update bad. No donor card accessible donation 8/24 left scrambling morning find old card. Rapid pass code longer appears either. History missing lot info. Want old version back!!
16259,Blood Donor,The new update shows vitals last two donations. It used show them. I relied history track hemoglobin levels avoid deferral. Used 5 stars.
16260,Blood Donor,"Love (scheduling, history), last update rendered digital donor card useless - there's barcode scan! The nurse ended ordering new physical card."
16261,Blood Donor,Latest update issues: donor card longer available donation check-in; times making appointment show GMT time rather local time; longer perform rapid pass right completed rapid pass appear app. Donation history info greatly reduced detail quantity.
16262,Blood Donor,So complete survey donor ID card button longer actually donor ID barcode it. Not sure that's fair tradeoff.
16263,Blood Donor,Great except bar code missing donor card. And takes longer donating blood and/or Platelets.
16264,Blood Donor,Will allow enter donor card info. Will allow change/correct name.
16265,Blood Donor,"This makes blood donation process even easier!! Able schedule appointments, complete rapid pass beforehand, carry electronic donor card. Recommend app!"
16267,Blood Donor,The update removed barcode....
16268,Blood Donor,Very useful app!
16269,Blood Donor,"It's convenient schedule donations, listed available appointment times starting hours listed start time drive. The donor card scannable bar code. Integration blood center system could better. After I typed donor ID, I tell system I appointment, write piece paper."
16270,Blood Donor,Rarely works properly also providing accurate information donations donation history. Some errors leave Red Cross exposed legal liability. Surprised lawyers greenlighted this; I have.
16271,Blood Donor,"Been using awhile schedule Donation appt. without issues now. Scheduled 8:00 am, put @ 1pm"
16272,Blood Donor,"Enjoy app. Has usefull convenient. BUT latest update...at ""home"" ""Profile"" page, displays next appointment November. My next appointment August. Is display problem? Or August appointment wiped out?"
16273,Blood Donor,Other Rapidpass useless. Blood pressure history gone barcode donor card. Do people even listen donors?
16274,Blood Donor,"This matured useful tool. However latest revision seems eliminated historical vitals data includes last donations data. I enjoyed this, taking something away I liked I'm rating 2. Would 5."
16275,Blood Donor,The donor card portion I told insufficient donation site. Why donor card bar code that's required me? How nonsensical that?
16276,Blood Donor,"In last update, someone decided good idea remove bar code donor card. This code used check center, nurses get donor information. Put barvode back please."
16277,Blood Donor,"Easy tracks donations include number lives touch. Makes scheduling easy. Just make sure rapid pass day appointment, day before."
16278,Blood Donor,This way helpful I expected. Definitely necessity donating blood. Made experience much faster enjoyable.

16280,Blood Donor,Where blood pressure history go? I see last reading.
16281,Blood Donor,I want know go donate blood. I want create frigging user account. Uninstalling now....
16282,Blood Donor,"Can't even sign in. Uninstalled, going back"
16283,Blood Donor,"I would much happier programmed following new improved features: data visualization function blood details time per donation. For example, I want see trend blood pressure time, I also want see Trendline average. Also, gave push notification survey right donation kept open completed expires 30 days. Lastly, setting saying Do Call me, provide texting, push notifications instead."
16284,Blood Donor,"Nice reminders appointments. It never find blood drives I know occurring, matter I search them. So I able sign ANY drives via phone. Also, local drive I appointment appointment I got there. I still wait while. The needs used organizers well make work right."
16285,Blood Donor,Super convenient donor card rapid pass available app. I love getting notifications blood journey. Such great feeling know way hospital. The blood journey info always date though. Love badges knowing many gallons I donated.

17489,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Best to follow Brazilian championship
17490,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,The Atletico goal was canceled. Why did the anti-lords of this one keep 1x0 for so long? Good. That disappointed. Went
17491,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,So did my concept. Since yesterday it does not update.
17492,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,The is great. It just does not respect notification settings. I've already checked that no notifications appear and I keep getting more than 10 a day.
17493,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Excellent APP! Very well done and light. Mandatory for those who enjoy football and want to follow Brasileirão!
17494,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Very good.

17496,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Very good vai Corinthians
17497,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,You just have to put the option to simulate the results so that we have a sense of how it can be played if our team wins or loses

17502,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Good
17503,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,"Good app. It has the potential to become great. My recommendations: -Add other competitions -Synchronize match schedule with mobile phone -Lance bid with information about them -To show start time -To show% of winning time in the competition -To show performance in the last 5 games (eg 3 wins, 1 draw , 1 defeat = VEDVV)"
17504,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,I have been using it since its first release and there have been few problems over the years. Only need to have C series to be complete.
17505,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Weak. Schedule TWO games is not synchronized with cellular GPS. Games in progress do not provide start time
17506,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,Best app ever! But .... Is it too much to ask for a version that joins Brazilians and liberators?

17522,Brasileirão Pro 2018 - Série A e B,"Great app, I just wanted it to have information of goal assists in game information, and statistics like stolen ball. It would be perfect to have everything in one app, thinking like a player in a top hat."

17967,Bualuang mBanking,The Good Parts: small starts fairly quickly. Goes direct info users likely want see. What It Needs: Cardless ATM feature similar SCB. Bugs: The Show Transfers action show transfer I made earlier today via iBanking. The Show Payment function show payment made AIS yesterday. Balance incorrect withdraw money using another platform logged app. Pointless OTP others commented.
17968,Bualuang mBanking,"Agreed with most others. I do not know what to do. I do not know how to make a new account. I do not know what to do. Why do not you have a star? Why do not you have a star? ""-"
17969,Bualuang mBanking,"It is very easy to open a full function, it is not easy to submit documents at the branch. Then go to the ATM to press the code again. Until now, it's still not enabled."
17970,Bualuang mBanking,Why is that? Can I transfer numbers or Id? It's a good idea.
17971,Bualuang mBanking,I do not know what to do. Multiple Cache Closed still the same Very bad system
17972,Bualuang mBanking,Have you ever had a favorite? The good thing is through wifi.
17973,Bualuang mBanking,"I have a lot of time to make transactions, I need to make sure to improve the server and stability of the Green Bank can not. There are a lot less problems than this one."
17975,Bualuang mBanking,If you do not call 1333 then I do not know what it is. It's easy to use. Do not use the load to consume memory. I have a lot of troubles. It's a lot of fun.
17976,Bualuang mBanking,Frequent attempts to launch an app on a new machine are more difficult than that of another.
17977,Bualuang mBanking,"After updating, the wifi is not working."
17978,Bualuang mBanking,I have to go to see the green camp that he has to do a lot of development.
17979,Bualuang mBanking,I see details transactions last 3 days. The call center cannot either. I suspend card 5 days I get details suspicious transaction.
17980,Bualuang mBanking,I do not know how to do it.
17981,Bualuang mBanking,I just want to change the bank. But the salary at this -_-
17982,Bualuang mBanking,I do not know what to do.
17983,Bualuang mBanking,This is not the case.
17984,Bualuang mBanking,"Often, it is very important in the time of severe depression."
17985,Bualuang mBanking,No fingerprint scans at all.
17986,Bualuang mBanking,View user's profile Send private message I do not see it.
17987,Bualuang mBanking,Very slow to use as far as the bank's neighbors.
17988,Bualuang mBanking,"Let's have a day, not adjust anything at all 31/7/61."

18003,Bualuang mBanking,"Consider update update min/target SDK. The OS even warn user designed older version Android. TBH, look outdated."
18004,Bualuang mBanking,To view the application of SCB is like it. What do you do? The transfer will not transfer the system over. The bank has no problems at all.
18005,Bualuang mBanking,The error updated 31 May 2018 unavailable contact call center 1333 02-645-5555

18475,Buienradar - weer,"Since the last update, rain radar does not work anymore, does not start up anymore and gives an error message. That's why now only 1 star, which is actually too much for a non-working app. More stars when the weather works."

18807,Business Calendar 2,"I like basic version OK--nice colors decent syncing across apps--but I would upgrade paid pro version, someone would confirm whether ALARM notification feature--i.e., actul wake-up type alarm, NOT one-time vibration pop-up window--can easily set notifications. It's little pricey that's feature I would really looking upgrade, I can't tell that's actually included not."
18810,Business Calendar 2,"Easily best calendar I ever used; syncs seamlessly Google Calendar Tasks (both backbone short- long-term planning), extends functionality without bloated dubiously useful features. I especially appreciate fact task lists include sub-tasks. My complaint appear desktop extension, since online time spent mobile tablet, minor complaint indeed."
18811,Business Calendar 2,"Just great calendar app. Love dark theme, visual layout, agenda widget (!), tasks events easy set up, customizable (including recurrence, though takes getting used to), sync calendar subscriptions (I found regional holidays, I'm interested others too), shows/hides local Google calendars, on. They even offer (pay) calendar subs sports/tv, want (not now, interesting option)."

18815,Business Calendar 2,"I've REALLY want stick BC I start, But UI less user friendly rival Calengoo (has view tabs much customizable), harder switch views, harder select individual calendar task lists (especially using phone portrait view many lists/calendars .. Calengoo individual calendar buttons multiple rows ). Also secondly, biggie me, selecting task widget ""task list"" view, actually separate different task list headers (like Calengoo successfully), makes useless me. Selecting ""Task Lists"" give TASK LISTS widget!! Overall good app, looks nice, lacks lot functionality. I've tried communicating devs, ... hope listen. I feel like I'm forced go elsewhere, functionality must come first."

18826,Business Calendar 2,"I tried many calendar available search best fits needs, best. I interested upgrading pro version, question so. Is $4.99 fee time fee, yearly fee, monthly fee?"

19086,C Programming,"This good beginners. It's better reference guide something along lines. It designed educate person prior experience, lightly goes basic terms, describes confusing way without giving good enough examples how/why ""learned"" works. So far nothing reading, too. I thought, I downloaded it, would interactive might teach something, monitor progression test proficiency. Giving direction move in. This assumes lot knowledge subject right beginning."
19087,C++ Programming,How many ads take How many ads take crash tablet? I started read intro 3 ads!! Then wanted back main menu another ad! Then I wanted close guessed it. Another add. Granted free add intensive I would pay add free version.

19091,C++ Programming,"bad examples Many example programs either title implies, they're bad code. This case couple free c++ apps. This also frequent ads, pretty annoying trying code quickly."
19092,C++ Programming,Very useful I've really hard time understanding prof subject totally good. But 1 thing want example programs hehe.
19093,C++ Programming,"Not best ,several errors Bro I give advice install error like header file missing"
19094,C++ Programming,"Good needs improvement There many ads answers satisfactory. Yet, still beneficial many ways definitely help exams self-tutorial guide."
19095,C++ Programming,"Can give less zero stars? Possibly misleading tittle could chosen. Not content poorly explained, ""genius"" slapped ""masterpiece"" together makes many assumptions user hardly call educational app. It's like commercial get tricked downloading. It sucks donkey balls!"
19096,C++ Programming,"Good The great. The problem much ads. I know developer needs bread advertising, ad-free paid version would great us hate distracting ads."

19167,CAIXA,"Good afternoon, I'm grateful that you've answered the problem with a barcode scanner. It really is not a problem related camera apparatus or photography situation. With other applications reading normally occurs, only with the box that gives this little bug. I think it's because of the Android version (8.0). Maybe there is some big in this version only, and because few users use this Android version, end up having little report on case. I would like you to check if there is really any problem regarding this in the application itself. He usually reads 5 digits but then reads everything wrong."
19168,CAIXA,"Whenever I enter the error and appears: ""digital player operation canceled"". There I have to lock phone is unlock so you come back to recognize sensor. NOTE: In applications that also require digital input, such as Evernote, I do not have this problem."
19169,CAIXA,"The application itself is almost as good as Brazil bank. However, connection is A B-O-S-T-A. It takes me so long to log in that I save my cell phone to do something else and forget that I was trying to log in. Better it. BB does not have this problem."
19170,CAIXA,"SMS DEVICE ACTIVATION still does not appear, even clearing cache or uninstalling and reinstalling. I had to go to the agency to activate ..."
19171,CAIXA,"Horrible, when I go into my account it says it does not recognize user and password, always create a new user and error continues"
19172,CAIXA,"App bad, an institution so rich interest costs of the population should invest in something more simple and effective, this is the slowest banking application I have ever used, every option you click takes years to open even with a great phone and 100mega connection of speed."
19173,CAIXA,"Too slow even in authentication after login, sometimes or other biometric reader disables, gives mobile network error like a browser."
19174,CAIXA,"After a few weeks without using app, I tried to log into my account using digital, but said password was incorrect. I tried again, until I blocked my user. I created another user, and when I went to try to log in again it appeared that there was no user. I did the same thing again ... Full Review"
19175,CAIXA,"What good is application being ""good"" if bank is crap? Bureaucracy for everything .. In short, bank GARBAGE in my opinion."
19176,CAIXA,When I log into my account it says it does not recognize user and password. I've already created it several times and it's a mistake
19178,CAIXA,"very slow. Need to improve a lot still. I have already regretted asking for portability for cash, because it is so inferior to BB. It is slow to enter, slow in transactions, bar code reader takes reading. And form of the vouchers is awful! !! Not even ... Full Review"
19179,CAIXA,"Great application, was always intuitive and some months received modifications that made your look much more pleasant, moreover, got faster."
19180,CAIXA,Thanks for the latest update now I can place my Mega-Sena bets on my savings account. Thanks!
19182,CAIXA,You should put the links that have login on top as it is extremely annoying when you put your digital finger and your finger touches just opening a browser page.
19183,CAIXA,It is a lack of respect with your customers to keep one so bad. It always makes a mistake and I have not had access for 3 weeks. Shame!
19184,CAIXA,The barcode reader is not reading moto x1. The screen is all black and flashing. You can not tell where you're pointing. Before upgrading it was working.
19185,CAIXA,"Slow application to authenticate things and log in (when it does), cancels digital recognition operation constantly and now stopped recognizing my login and password. I tried to redo my registration and still nothing worked. Poor and bank, would not recommend."
19186,CAIXA,I have had trouble accessing my account via mobile. Ora informs on connection Ora informs q in hi recognizes user. Very Frustrating
19187,CAIXA,The application is not correctly generating the vouchers. It saves an almost all blank image and almost all information that appears on the screen when I complete a transaction.
19188,CAIXA,"Usability is poor, features are hidden. It took me a long time to find the option to withdraw the extract, when I could find an option, it did not help. I need extract as proof but unfortunately extract generated by does not include the account data, presents ... Full Review"
19189,CAIXA,"Worst Worst Bank ... A shame that I am obliged to be client of the cashier because of financing. EDIT: After the update, same thing continues"
19191,CAIXA,Horrible app. Just use it for what I need. You now stopped logging in. Very harmed. Throw it out and do it again. Oh really!
19192,CAIXA,"Good functions, but it gets very bad password. And whenever that happens you have to recreate user."
19193,CAIXA,"Lately it's a horrible experience with the box, when I try to access most of the time I get a message that user or password was not recognized (SSO-SI) For this and others I have used Banco Brasil more and more!"
19194,CAIXA,"If an error occurs, it is necessary to do all the registration again."
19197,CAIXA,"Too bureaucratic, any error returns to the home screen. Horrible."
19198,CAIXA,Economic box is not bank of internet.app branch breaks
19199,CAIXA,"There is no ""cancel service"" option. Why not?"

19201,CAIXA,"Could have option to play lotofácil, avoid queues in lottery!"
19202,CAIXA,"I can not change my digital signature, always the error."
19203,CAIXA,"Horrible app, walking trash, slower than tortoise, carries NOTHING."
19204,CAIXA,"The problem is that I can not log in anymore, it says that my account is locked"
19205,CAIXA,I can not sign up for favorite transactions. You are giving an error and closing session

I'm invested game I constantly optomize machines therefore little gold, due disinterest I feel little need sell parts quantity great easily navigate parts menu, point I spend 15 minutes (no exaggeration) selling abundance parts. Which I'd like ask for/suggest devs add quick-sell function.

24978,Championat,"Why can not I sign up for Minnesota's favorite team, and I can do other MLS teams, what kind of discrimination is this?"
24979,Championat,"Everything was fine ... Now notifications are not turned off, they are disconnected more precisely and in a few hours again they arrive that is not at all interesting at 3 o'clock in the morning to the same. You open the profile - again notifications are turned on."
24980,Championat,"Why can not we make a play in the play, normal tree-like grid so that we can see the score in the series and who goes to the next stage, and when you clicked on the series you got into the history of previous matches, it's so hard?"
24981,Championat,"Matches teams of the youth league uef not displayed in the fan zone, is it a bug or so conceived?"
24982,Championat,Do not put the pros and cons to the comments. server error
24983,Championat,The bug on the bug and bug podgonyaet
24984,Championat,"Not professional journalism in the news, the ""no notifications"" settings are constantly getting confused, the moderators do not know what they are doing - the comments section turned into some kind of wall in the toilet, where everything is allowed to write, I would even say in the toilets for censorship and masterovitey will. Reprinting the same interview and breaking it down into 10-15 headline articles. Normally you will not see the video. Constant advertising about stakes and contract matches ... I do not even want to continue. One advantage is that it opens and works without lags."
24985,Championat,Tournament Table does not work
24986,Championat,Not showing avatar
24987,Championat,I like
24988,Championat,Best
24989,Championat,Top
24990,Championat,Why did you decide that uninterrupted type alerts for important results are needed by everyone? While the application was not asked - it should be silent.
24991,Championat,"For half a year I can not log into my account from the application - ""try again after 70 seconds"""
24992,Championat,"Why did you remove the ""tags"" in the news that help determine the sport? ((And not all athletes who have at least a photo on the site are in the application."
24993,Championat,Do not turn off notifications
24994,Championat,"Good App, but UPDATE TOURNAMENT TABLES - last season show."
24995,Championat,Flies out when reading articles
24996,Championat,"Guys, well, not so much advertising, every small video in one article with advertising. Annoying."
24997,Championat,"Why can not I add a command to follow it. Example: I can not follow the basketball team ""Dome-Springs"", and for St. Petersburg ""Spartacus"" I can, although ""Spartacus"" is in the second Superleague, and ""Springs"" in the first Super League. Please correct."
24998,Championat,Excellent
24999,Championat,"Good app, lots of news everything is fine. But! Appreciated by 4 because there is no English version. I want to read all the news in English. Please organize this function."
25000,Championat,Great update
25001,Championat,"The best app for sports fans! All works on hurray! Tell the address of the developer, I will come and personally shake hands!"
25002,Championat,"Has removed. Tucked up this bought resource. I read other sources. Cleaner. It's normal, but it's better when the news is on 1 place, and then already the favorites - my tape. Android 4.2.1 china phone star 7589 Hangs after transition from push notification to the main window. My children ... and where is the window where you can see what you signed to receive push messages? He is not! And how quickly to work with this? Unsubscribe if, what? Well, you then at least a little think about how to live with these people when you code the program! There are many things, we must climb on this anthill. In general, not bad, we will get used to it. The main thing often is not to change. Advertising from greed."
25003,Championat,HateRambler An obfuscation from a govn company!
25004,Championat,Thank you. Very cool thank you to you.
25005,Championat,Cumbersome The previous version was more compact and informative. Usability was killed. The past global update was much better.
25006,Championat,"Remarkably I can say that the application has become much more convenient, the developers have tried to glory, especially Vic"
25007,Championat,"Not great design Need update design , otherwise seems soviet union back smartphones"
25008,Championat,"Problems with photos in articles Insertions into articles from social media players - a good idea, but these inserts are not displayed in the application. Therefore, the material about the draft or, for example, the review of social media players in the application to view uncomfortable"
25009,Championat,"Application norms, the best of the Russian, perhaps the application is good, but with the interface trouble: then there is not everything shows, then on the button back you expect to return to the news list, but instead you leave. But at 4 will go"
25010,Championat,"Well overall I would have finalized the filters, or rather I'm interested in not all the information about football, but a specific league, but here everything is together. Or something like something with tags."
25011,Championat,"Works Heavy application, slows down even on nexus 4. In general, it is quite convenient."
25012,Championat,"You need to add more features and fix the flaws. For example, the problem with matches today and now, those that are currently not displayed in today. You need to add a tab tomorrow. The rest is not bad."
25013,Championat,"Excellent Cool app! I would like to be able to track the news not only for my favorite teams, but also for players and coaches."
25014,Championat,"Many problems. 1. See tomorrow's matches how? 2. Directly from the protocol of the match I would like to watch the grid of the tournament or table. 3. Favorite tournaments are constantly dumped. 4. Complex, strange, incomprehensible navigation on the site. And that's not all, and it's impossible to describe everything. There are many problems, I would like you to read your wishes, work on this, and not stand still."
25015,Championat,"Excellent application Everything is fine, except for a few things: 1) there is no TV guide, you have to go to the site after it 2) you can not delete at least once the selected tournament on the form of selecting sports in the ""you searched earlier"" section 3) on the match statistics form is convenient it would have been bookmarked ""tomorrow"" in addition to ""yesterday, now, today"" Otherwise everything works as it should :) Thanks."
25016,Championat,Design Could hire a good designer for their official application
25017,Championat,"Cool But you need more photos and videos attached to the posts. And so, everything is on the level)"
25018,Chapters: Interactive Stories,It would great easier way earn gems. It would also great could could customize characters. At least Choices start gems. You give us anything cost fortune. I'm spending money here. I likely delete game I finish story.
25019,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"The game entertaining, gems get way it. You require many gems time recieve 1 per chapter - unless sit watch ads over. Somethings got give ratio. You need another way earn gems require spending much time ads good outcome."
25020,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"I love game far, there's two things though: adds & choices/gems. Please get rid adds, they're really annoying wait skip them. If going get rid them, least change while. For many choices make need gems, select good choice, receive gem. However, hard receive gems unless get achievements, choices completing chapter. I think ways get gems. Maybe go adds rate games made company. An easier way get gems would really useful."
25021,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"It's money grabbing game. All good choices paid there's like 5 per chapter. 2 3 choices bought, end worst choice time unless pay gems..."
25022,Chapters: Interactive Stories,As games much choice can't afford constant supply diamonds. Weight world far story felt like I able make choices without diamonds especially end. Also stories dont allow us choose character's race
25023,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I understand start 6 stars whatever first thing pay 12. I think start 6. Try 20 30.
25024,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"Heres truth The game like choices. You spend money get good choices. Money time. And dont choice skintone, hair clothes. Its okay.. But Im HIGHLY annoyed. The choices make isnt fun.."
25025,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"This addicting game. Lots fun great way pass time. The 2 downfalls are: pay story direction advertisements bit annoying. Other that, I would given 5/5."
25026,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"It's okay interesting stories (at moment anyway). A great pro watch videos almost whenever want get free gem, premium choices game always feel like waste, like matter expensive important choice I pay is, ultimately means nothing achievement trophy. I'm least hoping get stories future give multiple choices love interest instead sticking us might dislike entire book maybe able choose character's skin color gender future releases?"
25027,Chapters: Interactive Stories,The worst thing able customize characters like Choices. Not immersive character looks nothing like you. It much fun.
25028,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"These games okay. It's hard get gems without paying though, charge 20+ gems choices/outfits/etc little crazy considering get 1 gem chapter complete. It kind defeats whole point game make choices guide story. If gems choice really want make really story anymore."
25029,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"This game pretty good. I like stories I reading far. One thing keeping giving 5 stars options. Many choices involve diamonds, I really stuck choice sucks. Also diamond choices 17 12. These choices also come lot within chapter since I gain 1 diamond I read chapter, impossible able choose choices without paying them. If button watch ads, I would watch million ads order gain diamond per ad. This way still make money ad revenue user gets diamonds need make better choices without buy want to. Other that, pretty compelling stories."
25030,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I like game I wish individual chapter longer. Having 8-10 min long gets annoying try get story. Other I love game
25031,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Going delete I finish 1 story I chose. I receive Daily tickets anymore know why. The ads way many way little diamonds. Fun worth time.
25032,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Not many good stories here... They need add new. Not happy chapter's need improvement I feel. If romance chapter's you.
25033,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Love game! Really addictive except I slight problem. There many ads. Would really appreciate got rid them. Other 4 stars me!
25034,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"Love it! Better artwork non gem choices ""Choices"", different Episode! I wish watch ads gems worked, I get lot video available messages :("
25036,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Great game addictive.... I hate get free gems beginning game... But everything amazing great graphics ❤️❤️
25037,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"Definitely good interactive story game I highly recommend playing this, I hope you, game designers,can add thriller horror stories maybe romance, keep good work."
25038,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"I love all, maybe add character customization option? Like maybe want girl boy. Otherwise everything great! Also maybe add LGBT+ stories. That would AWESOME really make Chapters better rest"
25039,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I would give game 5 stars I stuck black screen story. I'm happy right niw!
25040,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Very addictive. Great stories! Just wish would let regenerate tickets earn instead taking back two.
25041,Chapters: Interactive Stories,It gives load screen freezes. This dumb wasted data downloading nothing!
25042,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Would better I could make choices buy gems ... gives 3 choices choose 1 spending money
25044,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I bought 60 gems $5 disappeared without using them. Don't waste money
25045,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"The game intresting stories (At times) But I feel lot positive reviews bots accounts game creators made since game really good overall,I want seem like total B really fair. The stories often involve romance,Which fine awhile gets tad annoying also kinda forces choose people options. I also want point big issue,The game basically traps option unless want pay diamonds (If any) Personally I feel making options super expensive get people buy diamonds company get money,And often traps player option make story better gets quite annoying.I want seem mean anything since constructive criticism (For people know) But game A LOT flaws need fixed. Overall, I good experience play fix issues. Some good things game pretty good diamonds,They give often fix it,The ticket system also worst giving tickets.Personally I enjoy graphics enjoy lot stories I ignore issues,But game lot things work on. Goodday,And good luck (I wasted much time review)"
25046,Chapters: Interactive Stories,This awesome I love stories much. I love fact I make choices I would make real life wish I had.
25047,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I love game. There deep many stories choose similar games. I wish chapters came little faster maybe estimated schedule. Need fantasy stories apposed love stories
25048,Chapters: Interactive Stories,I want HAVE spend money maker decisions I want to.
25049,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"This really fun game, I want lgbt books. I mean, there's like 1 2 lgbt books there, rest straight stories. I want lesbian gay stories added soon ^^ And offer get 20 dimaonds go?"
25050,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"Good stories tickets added reasonable pace, options replying could cost fewer gems though ."
25051,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"This awesome people like read, take long finish story."
25052,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Love it. Things cost many gems good
25053,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"The Ads interrupt lot, dont like every lol overall interesting always ! This go I get free time !"
25054,Chapters: Interactive Stories,freezes loading page keep 'checking new book' even though already 100%
25055,Chapters: Interactive Stories,It's cute little book game thing however diamonds make choices stuff ridiculous cost much money need many diamonds things
25056,Chapters: Interactive Stories,"I like stories, I wish could earn diamonds quickly. Like maybe short quiz stories something. I also wish could gain tickets continue reading"
25057,Chapters: Interactive Stories,Usually stuck welcome screen. (Check new book loading screen). The game usually stop middle. This updated version bad
25058,Chase Mobile,"Zelle feature implementation flawed. If can't transfer money different banks using name phone/email, Zelle helpfulness reduced drastically. Sometimes need transfer money banks another since person, number email. However, great handy exactly set do. Highly recommended though."
25059,Chase Mobile,"Love changes made app. First I like Zelle portion app. I like there's advertising get others join. I also like fact view balance without logging time. I like background changes tothe day night. Finally, credit monitoring part convenient. I alerted someone using email ""dark web"". They prompted change passwords I immediately."
25060,Chase Mobile,"It's clean user friendly banking app. Only real problem sometimes I depositing check via Chase App, keeps telling pictures clear enough, even pictures clear be. It takes tries, works. Other that, nice easy app. Definitely recommended."
25061,Chase Mobile,"Chase I applaud you! You companies size actual put ""anything"" what's new area update. Thank you! The works well, functional, things little hard find sometimes include sidebar main account view."
25062,Chase Mobile,"These constant updates eating data. I've already deleted everything else make room app. Im quickly running space, I may drop soon. Like everyone else I love Chase too, but... All I want, pay bills check balance then. I'm trying run business, anything else offers. Is simpler version require constantly large monthly updates?"
25063,Chase Mobile,"Chase great bank, I ha e used much past. Recently I chose turn notifications bothered phone found CONSTANTLY HARRASSED turn back notifications. I turn notifications, I wanted so. I turned stop HARRASSED every time I used it. Very disappointed developers handled this."
25064,Chase Mobile,"This used work great, anymore. For last two weeks I would get black screen 15-30 seconds I could access balance, would act sluggish afterward. Now current update, crashes I open it!!!!! What purpose serve can't check bank balance??!!"
25065,Chase Mobile,"Clean interface, seen many bugs yet. However, thing really lacking - ability temporarily block card app. This becoming standard designed manage payment card. Update: recent version broken. Will open."
25066,Chase Mobile,Used good every single time I log reset password. Not sure what's going I even tried online instead using still problem. Is password changed made irrelevant? VERY FRUSTRATING!!!
25067,Chase Mobile,"Terrible...constantly ""detects"" changes fingerprint settings take password. Whenever happens, I reset password get ""you can't password current one"" work I originally tried it. This turning inconvenience convenience. Therefore, 1 star is."
25068,Chase Mobile,Will allow log via fingerprint sensor even though I feature enabled. Also completely stopped working week ago. The also allow log in. I resort calling make payment order avoid charged late payment fee. Extremely bad experience.
25069,Chase Mobile,requires access phone sms data latest update. Will work access phone data sms data allowed. I dont understand bank wants access sms data call data phone. Why Chase care know I call text? Uninstalled privacy reasons. Very intrusive.
25070,Chase Mobile,"I previously gave 5 stars I changed 2 stars due glitch. The worked many years, user friendly , convient fast. But last days glitching note8. I unable view current transactions accounts. Please fix this."
25071,Chase Mobile,Updated acting screwy. It let program I log out. Also need private information order bills delivered app.
25072,Chase Mobile,"Every time I log I turn setting unlock fingerprint, every single time I open tells detected change fingerprint settings, NEVER is, BEYOND irritating... Takes forever load, half time tells unable connect, ridiculous! Makes want switch banks altogether"
25073,Chase Mobile,A somewhat well made app. Always serves financial needs well. Lately issues wanting log in. Fingerprint login worked months. Yet works perfectly every single phone. Fix get 5 stars.
25074,Chase Mobile,"Completely useless. You sign every time user pass. Finger print work unless do. My password strong random I change frequently should, thus I memorized."
25075,Chase Mobile,This glitchiest I ever used. The iPhone works great Android version mess. All tasks constantly revert back home accounts screen. Trying deposit check signs out. It's completely unusable
25076,Chase Mobile,Consistantly crashes. Slow loading. Lag typing navigating menus. Now I see black screen I sign in. Its dead phone. 7/26/2018 edit: super slow updates im lead black screens. It doesnt even show activity anymore. Updates making thing worse worse. This completely useless. It used work perfectly.
25077,Chase Mobile,"You would think update released would improve rather making worse. For past weeks constantly shows black screen, takes long time load, respond well eventually ends crashing."
25078,Chase Mobile,"This could good except work unless allow Google Play Services access permissions I want Google - namely: Contacts, Phone, SMS none needed app. So, glancing balance worthless current state."
25079,Chase Mobile,6/22/2018 last update makes useless mobile banking. 7/24/2018 Chase bank international yet must built high school kids. Maybe high school kids could better. SunTrust Bank blows water. So bank Internet.
25080,Chase Mobile,"works okay actually let's sign in. Most time sits sign-in page I put correct password fingerprint. When making mobile deposits, I want manually able turn flash. The phone shadow gets way picture, flash removes shadow. Why can't I always flash instead automated light level? I trick camera holding phone dark, quickly taking picture light order flash work. Why can't I simply enable flash time? Stupid"
25081,Chase Mobile,"Although nice layout, generally unusable. For past year, every time I tried login would tell password wrong require password reset. Password always worked fine website. Today, let login all. No error, returns back login screen."
25082,Chase Mobile,"07/23/18 -Updated Update unable login. Uninstalled reinstalled, i'm able login get ""turn notifications?"" Loop login others. 07/18/18 - *---- Login hang ""loading"" goes back login. Unable login"
25083,Chase Mobile,"At beginning I problem. This 4th time I problems depositing checks. In past, I drive branch, make line, deposit checks. Totally inappropriate. Very unsatisfy."
25084,Chase Mobile,"I come back write review seeing two mobile financial institutions. Long story short, Chase measuring stick mobile online banking me, two come close. Easy monitor accounts, make transfers, highly intuitive use."
25085,Chase Mobile,"really like chase, employees, app. gotten better edit: still living except preview setting working since last update. really helpful i'm hurry. everything else good though"
25086,Chase Mobile,"This amazing till I got update today. Now everytime I try login loads bit never lets past login screen. I can't even see bank details. Pretty much useless point I'm deleting. Get together, Chase."
25087,Chase Mobile,"Update 7/30/18 - something broken new check deposit module. keeps saying picture clear I can't deposit checks. Previous review: Works much better Fidelity. Great interface, easy use."
25088,Chase Mobile,"Chase fine, lets u pay bills, see accts, transfer funds out. One big drawback: allow u see balance , like b a, citi, without logging in. Maybe u I clueless?"
25089,Chase Mobile,"What happened app? Constantly crashes, asks EVERY SINGLE TIME I log activate notifications, slow, letting pay bills. This used reliable I'd ever used!"
25090,Chase Mobile,"This works good monitoring activities card, scheduling payments. But asking every time I sign I want turn notifications, getting really annoying. No option"
25091,Chase Mobile,"Could better. Functionality intuitive, getting secure messages. And I like way gives notifications well pushed phone. If I've seen notification phone, I want see again. Not easy edit profile alerts, + give enough information transactions. But might Chase Bank general I've noticed they're getting really sketchy way business, money must tight."
25092,Chase Mobile,"Most aggravating ever. Fingerprint sensor works rarely. Won't accept typed password, accept new password, saying meet requirements new passwords. It's supposed make easier access account, instead, raises blood pressure. Would recommend."
25093,Chase Mobile,"used work great. Now I can't sign fingerprint even though set up, asks password always says wrong. Can't even get point. I see I'm issue. Is developer anything it?? useless point."
25094,Chase Mobile,"Agree users current problems. Can't finger print sign change passwords I tend keep forgetting I changed to. Used love app, WORST credit card banking companies."
25095,Chase Mobile,"Samsung 7S - Deposit, transfer, bill pay problems... When I fingerprint log in. The hanging past week. Will look like processing open open. Will change review Chase gets working again."
25096,Chase Mobile,This previously functionality. The latest update seems stolen usage customers. It far easier open go website. The constant logging security concerns B.S. I want log I feel like logging off.
25097,Chase Mobile,I used Banks come anywhere close Chase app. Got Everything I need easy use. It flaws I'm glad fix them. Thank CHASE

But othere I would recommend anyone enjoys good read interesting characters amazing plots. Sound tracks also pretty good too.
26305,Choices: Stories You Play,"Could've easily 5 star rating whole keys & diamonds downtime... especially diamonds, maybe get like 3/4 diamonds via watching videos & progressing diamond choices cost like 15+ action. Kind gets ridiculous /:"
26306,Choices: Stories You Play,This game makes spend money. In order progress build relationships need diamonds. It takes 2 hours get key. The person made money hungry unreasonable. Do highly frustrated free options horrible clothes boring scenes.

26308,Choices: Stories You Play,It would better pay arm leg diamonds. Also wait 2 hours free key receive 2 4 hours it. A things I wish.... Maybe monthly subscription unlimited. More keys 2 earned shorter time frame earn them. Also completing book could replay without using anything

There way earn extra diamonds, letting story replayed would great way it. All all, I'm still gonna play it. Some stories super good interesting, stories play earn diamonds better story. Life short, games waste away small amount time have. At least average."

26553,Cisco Webex Meetings,On Android sound horrible. But notifications nice loud sounded like everyone cursing getting beeped call.
26554,Cisco Webex Meetings,"Webex torture. Schedule links open app. Repetitive basic permissions. Meeting scheduling tedious error prone. All digits enter forces flip time limit dial-in. Audio underwater. Doesn't remember phone number. Mute makes loud disruptive beep, takes 2 secs delaying conversation. Video easily fit full screen difficult zoom across separately source, requiring constant manual management. Horrid user experience."
26555,Cisco Webex Meetings,"Would like see UI tweaks. Don't prompt open WebEx web, open it! Please remember password longer , / allow fingerprint authentication So I forced type password car! Otherwise, great app."

26576,Cisco Webex Meetings,Everything good except can't work well speaker phone options base phone also mute messy. Android Moto 5gs plus
26577,Cisco Webex Meetings,"Clunky, can't meet Linux desktop users."

26601,Cisco Webex Teams,"1. Earpiece work, speakerphone. Switching earpiece entirely mutes audio. 2. Active call difficult cancel, UI disappears minimized way get back active call screen open Settings menu, actually open settings, brings back screen. One wonder Cisco's QA team smoking. 3. You cannot tell Spark ring devices. Other, less annoing issues exist well."
26602,Cisco Webex Teams,"""Cisco Spark stopped working"" error group work. We 4 groups last days stopped working. Only seems issue Android devices Apple."
26603,Cisco Webex Teams,Unable turn speaker phone call. This makes calling aspect useless.
26604,Cisco Webex Teams,"Updating review version updates new features. I like integration notification updates. Great except I still cannot proximity new spark board AND voice text. I manually toggle proximity near spark board everywhere else. After year, I would figure would fixed. Taking away star that. I give update taking another star. Come Cisco fix proximity voice recognition! Took away another star!"
26605,Cisco Webex Teams,"Stable enough keep phone current version near-crippling bug: long-running spaces (e.g., one-on-one close coworkers) get hung ""not sent"" messages months ago, meaning scroll miles see current discussion. Fix might 5 stars though."

I CONSTANTLY get ""offline, connected"" error, I'll send message it'll hang ""sending"" I finally copy it, close app, paste resend it. It's become basically unusable comes posting deadline, I never know message actually going send not."

26617,Cisco Webex Teams,"It's working slow Consuming much memory, compare what's"
26618,Citi Mobile®,"Has gone hell. Takes FOREVER login (that's IF lets login all!), fingerprint works/doesn't, keeps telling I need activate card activated ages ago. Soooo frustrating. If card tied Costco membership, I'd cancel constant annoyance."
26619,Citi Mobile®,This shltty program work 18 times 20. It constantly let dashboard pay bill see what's card. If get need see details transaction tell temporary works let it. Basically I remember software working properly last 3 years. Horrible product. Or programmers get paid jobs. Only horrible feelings app.
26620,Citi Mobile®,"The got stuck today login phase, I clear data reinstall. Even start-up incredibly slow. (Even ""rotating wheel"" stopped rotating) Usually fine, check deposit camera worked fine last times I tried it."
26621,Citi Mobile®,This glitches loading login screen allow view banking info. I apple device works flawlessly. It bettee setup opinon. I uninstall rarely loads account info. Disappointment
26622,Citi Mobile®,"Takes FOREVER open (if all). Then open able login, WILL, 100% time, crash eventually stop working. Filled errors bugs. You're better using mobile browser. used useful functional. Idk happened. At point many months fixed problems."
26623,Citi Mobile®,"The features layout great. But soooo slow open up. I've tried cell service, WiFi, phone (LG G6), girlfriend's phone (S9+)... none makes difference. Dunno bug whatever. Would great fixed."
26624,Citi Mobile®,"I never used glitches, temporary delays service, slow response load times. I could never bank Citi knowing I would app. If love costco card would delete Citibank entirely phone life. What trash app."
26625,Citi Mobile®,"Slow often freezes, I hate using it.... Citi shame you. 4/11update logging presented ""!00""..... awful app.... take lesson Discover Cards app! 8/1 update: takes 60 open. Looking GPS location??? Useless!"
26626,Citi Mobile®,"I must echo awful reviews. Android tablet, running oreo. Won't even give sign screen, frozen circle. Installed uninstalled multiple times. Very frustrating. Capital One best app."
26627,Citi Mobile®,I understand can't access ZELLE via app. It allows send pop money. I laptop access zelle website. Are guys going allow payments/transfers via Zelle near future?
26628,Citi Mobile®,"It hard believe company much money horrible. This without doubt worst phone. Fingerprint scan issues, depositing checks taking photo back side check practically impossible. So bad. Unreal"
26629,Citi Mobile®,"Used work fine great. Now stopped opening. Problem started several days ago. Re-downloading solve problem. I hope fix soon, convenient able monitor spending phone."
26630,Citi Mobile®,"still intermittent problems. One snapshot keeps crashing app. The allow schedule payment vendors (like AMEX) next day. Forces go order accomplish this. Please fix. Alerts timely. Other banks like Chase send alerts problem happens transfer money charges incur. Citibank sends alerts next day, charged. Even catch make transfer, Citi still makes another transfer charge you. You guys better."
26631,Citi Mobile®,"This needs lot work. There lot bugs. For example, I log out, I log back clicking ""back"" button phone. It also randomly fail give option uploading checks via mobile deposit sometimes, even gone daily limit. The ""contact us"" button work--your better finding correct phone number online."
26632,Citi Mobile®,"This rarely opens I need it. I sign notifies updated I sign AGAIN. It slow I hardly manage anything without going website. My internet fast, lag every time I want look account. Plus, I DO get I try pay ""other amount "" often times work I find log start again."
26633,Citi Mobile®,"Other looking pretty, low quality around. Won't remember preferences, it'd keep promoting features (such snapshot view fingerprint authentication). Doesn't matter many times enable them, completely forget choice prompt again. Everything slow takes forever get anything done. If *required* things like check depositing, I'd never app."
26634,Citi Mobile®,Takes ridiculous time load. Looks like trying get gps location info show sign screen... There better way. It's quicker easier simply website.
26635,Citi Mobile®,Must worst banking there. Constantly freezing crashing me. Would faster I went saw teller. Never remembers settings show last 15 transactions. Really horrible app.

26638,Citi Mobile®,It used work fine. Now taking longerrrrrrr get login/fingerprint screen update. It hangs like taking break wakes seems like long nap continues login. Weird stuff. This LG G6. But I tried others too. Clearing data/Reinstall help. Please un-break it.
26639,Citi Mobile®,"This completely broken. When first loading sits minute giving login screen. After trying transfer funds sits loading icon forever, I quit out. This truly awful, offers zero functionality."
26640,Citi Mobile®,Used work can't even get open anymore. Tried uninstall reinstall even open. Makes want cancel citi credit card bc terrible is. I can't even get pay account.
26641,Citi Mobile®,Painfully slow startup. Wouldn't register credit card (the reason I tried it) hangs trying. Uninstalled waiting working version.
26642,Citi Mobile®,"FOR AN SO""HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"", WHY DOES IT KEEP SAYING ""TRY BACK LATER"" AND ""DOESN'T RECOGNIZE YOUR PASSWORD""?!? THIS IS THE WORST EVER. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE"
26643,Citi Mobile®,"It uses good every time I fingerprint unlock it, shuts down. It's frustrating I got type long password."
26644,Citi Mobile®,"Has anyone able pay already listed external payee? It's weeks since I able process transfers accounts. All I get temporary system error -500. I banking applications always seems behind. Every account transfer met temporary error 500, even Citibank linked accounts. Is anyone working that?"
26645,Citi Mobile®,Only checking account cannot speak credit cards. It's pretty straight forward checking balances mobile deposits I find getting stuck lot. Also bit annoyed Citi supports zelle pay still cannot using app. You need go online using computer. The 3 banks I know access zellepay mobile apps.
26646,Citi Mobile®,"Very easy use, great layout. My big problem kept crashing everytime soon I signed I enabled thumb print ID. I uninstalled, reinstalled it. Has crashed without thumb print log in."
26647,Citi Mobile®,"Like works often login issues logged in, inability accomplish simple tasks... For weeks I get balance details accounts... Tells system error... I find easier mobile now... Hoping fix ASAP..."
26648,Citi Mobile®,"The I app, I realize poorly programmed. There things app, login's error flow, scream thrown together low budget"

26651,Citi Mobile®,"A young child mom's basement deliver better this. ""App stopped working"" message login, even update. Citibank general failing many ways"
26652,Citi Mobile®,This fairly unstable least used work. The latest update made unusable even seem load anymore.
26653,Citi Mobile®,"Mobile check deposit work sometimes, recourse fails. Often seems slow delays, too."
26654,Citi Mobile®,"Now version, take 1min start up. Once I tap app, screen shows loading circle, static one, moving one, makes feel dead, long wait time, gets app. And still, I enabled finger print login, option login interface??? Samsung s8"
26655,Citi Mobile®,"This plain broken. Provided actually login, every time able access feature due ""temporary delays"". It's annoying."
26656,Citi Mobile®,Last update let check thing credit card. Not happy all. It never allows view anything continues freeze. I longer go website.
26657,Citi Mobile®,***App broken July 31 update*** It would nice hang every time I opened get login screen. It's permissions issue either. Pixel v1 running Oreo July update.
26658,Citibanamex Movil,"Forget paying app, designed make fail payments get charged that. If want supposed still need go bank. Don't trust"
26659,Citibanamex Movil,"It's working expected, talking best bank Mexico good enough. Works check balance transfers!!"
26660,Citibanamex Movil,It has many problems with Android 8.1. You can not put a fingerprint to activate the netkey because as it has support for Oreo it thinks that you have the phone rooted. They have updated it several times but they still do not make it compatible for Android 8.1
26661,Citibanamex Movil,"I changed my phone to a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, to which I made no modification, however the application says that I can use the netkey because it detects a modified one, I am sure that for this same reason the much advertised functionality of using selfie appears and / or footprint. Banorte Scotia works well, so you can say it's possible to make it work."
26662,Citibanamex Movil,"In her eagerness to make her look pretty with the animations, I'm just slow, awkward awful. For everything wants to make transitions ""elegant"" ends up taking about 10 seconds to display my information I can do nothing while I see how everything unfolds."
26663,Citibanamex Movil,"I can not activate my mobile Netkey because it detects a modified OS, which is true now I have to use two devices. As a developer I suggest using Safety Net, my device is an Essential Phone running Android 8.1 with stock ROM"
26664,Citibanamex Movil,"The mobile netkey does not work on Android 8.1, they have months with the error report saying that they are fixing it, but nothing."
26665,Citibanamex Movil,"The new update is frozen on the home screen with a numeric keypad there is nothing else you can do. Please correct the problem fast, I use a lot now I know what to do"
26666,Citibanamex Movil,"Almost everything works well, only that the transfers are somewhat cumbersome to have to register the vcount that you want to send the money, they should replicate the transfer service, it is simpler and instantaneous, coupled with the lack of the possibility of withdrawing money. of your accounts only with the cell phone."
26667,Citibanamex Movil,"In my case after the update stopped working, the screen remains blank, and uninstall and install anything, help me if it is very useful Thank you and I am resolved!"
26668,Citibanamex Movil,"2018-08-01: Android 8.1 is still supported ?, Using a Pixel 2 XL with the latest security patch installed, the application correctly recognizes the Android version marks a ""modified version"", when it is.

26818,Clash Royale,"The game favors big spenders rigged deck rotations...used fun screwing decent players over. Also favored elixir spending. Opponent push 20 elixir 5. 100% rigged game unless wanna spend $1000s dollars like so-called ""pros"" youll never get anywhere."
26819,Clash Royale,Great game first C.O.C Royale nice work. I got idea another spin C.O.B.C. CLASH OF BATTLE CHEST. With characters people know love new experience way play game different chess's board arena's things like that. Just throwing sounds good.
26820,Clash Royale,Some things could improved still. But overall good game. Easily best. If best mobile game date. Clan war replaced clan chest though. Which kind sucked. Now everyone play everyday face burdon clan. Where could play like hour weekend collecting crowns clan. Now got play 3 battkes day. One batle next. Rinse repeat
26821,Clash Royale,"I playing game 2 years. But stop playing game twice getting good cards, specially legendary cards. MY collection still legendary even good epic cards. Whereas friends started play game received best cards well legendaries. I hope supercell ofcourse look matter ensure fall love game AGAIN."
26823,Clash Royale,"I would like know emotes in-app purchases only. I get need funding game, make buyable gems? Therefore players buy gems get players like without capability save gems them. I've playing long time saving gems I'd like something worth on. That's personal opinion. Overall game's great challenging good gameplay."
26824,Clash Royale,"It's basically high speed animated chess. The ""chess pieces"" (which various characters) interact battle destroy opponents towers other. The player wins utilizes characters effectively (by learning capabilities character interactions combinations them, timing placing place board, etc.) Incredibly fun & competitive: 3 minute battles 60 second tie breaker overtime needed. Not difficult learn."
26825,Clash Royale,My main problem Supercell games way opponents matched. Rarely opponents match equally. You work hard get good deck play someone far advanced deck bought game pairs people based trophies player manipulate. It would far fair leave arena advanced instead able fall back play easier players.
26826,Clash Royale,"I love game, I think great. I times I play due people toxic besides cool, I also like credit help support team. It seems like boys directly issue. So I guess script say get trouble,idk. It reminds WoW problems directly. Keep game top years, also add report bar toxic people hackers"
26827,Clash Royale,This game amazing I've playing long time. Even played games. The thing I think need global chat. It's hard find good clan even recruit Ayers without talking finding you. But I love it. Keep good work!!
26828,Clash Royale,"An awesome game play. Developer sure know keep surprising us new update. Overall enjoyable experience fun play. Nice graphic. The control smooth friendly user, much comment. I know everthings flaws disadvantages. Therefore, BIG THUMBS KEEP UP good work. Btw, would nice see leveled card evolved like clash clan..."
26830,Clash Royale,"For quite old game, deserve 2 stars. The battel system matching 2 levels opponents balance all. 1 level difference still understand. But 2 levels diff loose win easily matter counter, unless like hard counter. Need balance. And ppl, waiting counter ever fun all....."
26831,Clash Royale,"Even though strategy game, game decides put based deck cards. If game wants loose, will. Game programmed coins gems buy real money. Game good mind loosing lot win games get exited loose lot more, like casinos. I time killer never buy anything."
26832,Clash Royale,"So many butthurt comments, game becomes grind around 4k trophies. I account 500 wins 3800, least 10 legendaries. None paid for. Only thing would make game better gold game try different decks high levels without grinding gold years. With aside best free games market."
26833,Clash Royale,"Supercell Team, I would like suggest please make new emote available purchase using gold .....it's request! As I level 12 I need new emotes I can't buy I 16 credit/debit card.....please make changes next update..thanks"
26835,Clash Royale,SUPERCELL BETTER READ ME I need rebalance game. WHY DO I HAVE LEVEL 2 EPICS WHILE IM BATTLING LEVEL 9 EPICS AND LEVEL 4 COMMON WHY WHEN I CHAT WITH SORRY THERE ISN'T AN OPTION FOR OP TROOPS TO HE REPORTED. KILL THE WITCH ITS STILL WAY TOO OP
26836,Clash Royale,"I think game great, legendary cards easy get now. If I get I'm like wow. Two years ago, would best day life. So I think superscell add new card rarity, really hard find. That would make game way fun. I superscell read this, might make change."
26837,Clash Royale,"The game good (good graphics, fun competitive environment, rather easy get good card collection), yet ladder still needs work. More specifically, Supercell needs something levelled cards. It's fair someone maxed cards (*cough* ebarbs *cough*royal giant) cards dominate people lower levelled cards. If Supercell could fix (by maybe putting cap levels based king level) game would much better experience."
26839,Clash Royale,"I would suggest u game.... It good initial stages... Later u start recognising bugs, even u report resolve it, feedback system sucks, say facts, respond, instead block u.... I feel even 1 star game..... If I give negative star's, I would given it.... This game sucks"
26840,Clash Royale,Used enjoy game. Lately I able win single match. I 1 legendary card King lvl 8 yet I put king lvl 7's using practically whole deck legendaries. Those cards really effect match I done game
26841,Clash Royale,Good game. Lot things pass time. Good gameplay. Full strategy. Gets thinking. Overall good app. No adds free cards almost every day free epic cards Sunday well able request cards Sunday. I wish would include boom beach instead things clash clans. That would Interesting fun.
26842,Clash Royale,I looked everywhere game cant find feature see progress achievements. It used I idea far along I e.g. friend need donate clan mates. How I see progress? Did take feature away? Will give 5 stars I see it.
26843,Clash Royale,I love game. Played like almost whole life now. The game hard. Pay play '0'. I'm arena 12. It took 3 years get high....... I'm nothing compared top players pay play. This game gets harder year. I wish people drop down. Like lvl 12 vs me. I'm died.
26844,Clash Royale,"Well, I mean, apart ""bad luck"" (that I think completely part program) matches always perfect counter cards. I opening chest war I know hell happened chest disappeared. I mean that's all, bad optimization game, first time happen somebody else. So, could cool totally necessary fix it."
26845,Clash Royale,Back old days get legendary card would moon literally make happy whole week. Now yay... What i'm saying legendaries aren't even care anymore. It doesnt live rank anymore
26846,Clash Royale,"Like many reviews, game much pay win game. I enjoy game, favors players able pay get better cards. They rank faster usually get better cards chest. A friend mine spent 10 bucks game already bunch legendarys. He started way me, yet I still barely gotten legendary card. You easily able pay better people don't."
26847,Clash Royale,Been playing two years swings ruin game. If opponents random would 5 stars. But game matches similar decks recently lost causes long losing winning streaks. I'd rather win 3 5 games 60 100 8 game streaks happens often.
26848,Clash Royale,"The game glitches badly me. Which sucks I really like playing it. But bad I almost want quit. It closes battles, I relog battle hard come back I'm behind. Which I lose crowns get demoted. It's frustrating. I hate I spent money game work should. Even updates say bugs fixed, could better."
26849,Clash Royale,Plz make compatible Mali G72 MP3. I playing game old Redmi note 3 adreno 510 GPU & phone running 60fps. But recently bought new device Oppo Realme 1 & Mali G72 MP3 GPU quite powerful too. I checked GPU playing PUBG & tht sure GPU powerful adreno 510. I sure compatibility issue. Plz fix soon. Its running 60fps GPU
26850,Clash Royale,It best startegy game world. I play game 2 years. Daily play 1 hour. It's addictive. New updates good. But top players category default sometimes. E.g: I'm playing game 22/7/18(Sunday) first place goes player finish stadium.(211). The many glitches please mix
26852,Clash Royale,You need fix freezing glitching. It's annoying middle battle. No likes loose freezes. I've playing awhile still legendary cards. When friend started 3 them. When problems get fixed I'll play again. Until I'll wait better improvement.
26853,Clash Royale,"This game fun something matchmaking. You fight people levels ""pay play"". Sometimes I think I'm matched computer another human predictions made. And downward spiral, keep going intentionally. Dishonest take money."
26854,Clash Royale,"Gotta love stopped giving reasoning behind balance change. Why necessary nerf elixir collector make dead card, curious? Additional credit goes latest update ""solid"" nerfs mortar gob hut. Keep up."
26855,Clash Royale,Fun game even playing since release still lvl 10 gotten cards. Feels heavily biased towards pay players punishing free players. If big pockets game. If prepare struggle. One year later. Still bugs all.
26856,Clash Royale,Overall game good changing review 5 stars star many reasons so. If level level high opponent acceptable getting two/three level high opponent ang troops much high level win game like piece cake!! This hate game nowadays getting bugs
26857,Clash Royale,"Pos constantly disconnects players due poor served bw bugs cause crashes penalizes 'bad conduct' giving bam random match making. Great job, $uper$ell. I could 0 star I would. Done bs"
26898,Clash Royale,"The game favors big spenders rigged deck rotations...used fun screwing decent players over. Also favored elixir spending. Opponent push 20 elixir 5. 100% rigged game unless wanna spend $1000s dollars like so-called ""pros"" youll ... Full Review"
26938,Clash Royale,"1.) 3 hours open chest 2.) I played total new player I get matched players high level cards 3.) So 3 hours open chest able try open ONE gonna wait 12 hours hopefully get good cards even play? 4.)Waste time even WHEN want waste time, waste space game."
26939,Clash Royale,"This game addictive competitive. I playing game launch date. There plenty updates progress game make fair enjoyable. I play game daily, yet top. You'll spend money level. I I however enjoy playing friends family linked Facebook. I could say game enjoyable fun."
26940,Clash Royale,"When game released, rating 1 star. Gave another go last year,1 star. This year, still 1 star. This game garbage, almost space new players. High level players drop trophies kicks butts newbies players. Emotes piece ❤❤❤❤ And company nothing matchmaker. Getting matched level 12s lvl 10. It garbage, garbage may remain garbage. Update : Stars increased 3, support overall fantastic."
26941,Clash Royale,"The game fun great play. But clan wars added killed game. They took away many good things, like clan chest way get weekly loot, interest I died quickly addition clan wars. I hope improved immediate rewards return clan chest."
26942,Clash Royale,I used like game. Nowadays player leave without bad report 2 v 2. Make game less fun priority match bad. The game mostly pay win. The card balancing useless. Even new card useless repetation old card. Play game 2 years still new ideas updates. This game become common pay win games. Sure forget game soon enough.
26943,Clash Royale,"It's good everything WAY expensive. I saw legendary chest shop I could buy, chest, I pay 500 gems!!! And cost 5 dollars get much! And legendarys nearly impossible get! My account Arena 8 6 epic cards! ☺Comment want cheaper things easy get legendaries.☺"
26944,Clash Royale,"All games quiet phones lowest sound setting, however game heard mile away volume 1 phone. Also, someone AFK, take lead come back on, game notices allow losing player make comeback regardless elixir, skill many troops already play. Possibly worst game google play."
26945,Clash Royale,"Very fun. One thing though. I get offers shop chests cost real money lot. Make buy gems too, please. And make gems slightly easier get. One last thing, new cards harder get go next arena. But I still love game :)"
26946,Clash Royale,Awesome game held back intense micro transactions. Supercell taken micro transactions whole new level game. It's damn shame greed creates unbalanced game long run. Gold upgrading cards rare can't upgrade cards spending hundred's dollars. It's insane pay win mess ladder
26947,Clash Royale,2v2 section important part gameplay recently destroyed. The matchmaking realy suck BIG time. I paired every time weak partner chalangers maxed way win. I came game relax end angry frustrated. SUPERCELL fix otherwise players touch anymore . Seriously !
26948,Clash Royale,It's good fun game. Can become addictive. A put money still same. There's hacks tricks I think make spend money. Example see energy elixure I sent army 2 seconds send army recharge 3x faster. I regret putting money it. It's scam dont need put money th game.
26949,Clash Royale,This game really fun! The gameplay great characters really cool. My advice losing matches several times row take break come back while. We humans naturally salty can't help like that. So take break come back game later. But overall great game.
26950,Clash Royale,Alright pay win. Progression troop/card collection ridiculous chest four unlockable despite fact take hours. Pay win morons abuse skeleton army beginning levels beyond. Ridiculous. Outside okay kinda fun.
26951,Clash Royale,I changed rating 5 1. Main reason - There guy clan got double attacks war day 7 times I get double attack even single time. I spent 250$ game completely free play player. So I spend money biased game. The reason clan wars destroyed spirit new players level 8.
26952,Clash Royale,"Fun, quick, easy play. Chests limit number cards get day, get used it. I've playing apk I'm ways ahead, advice generally want drop trophies (might make crown chest easier get though), pushing hard almost guarantee paired stronger opponents."
26953,Clash Royale,"It much poor game, I sure far extend human human kind game. There stage must lose computer side slow put overpowered opponents make lose. Plying exile bar shame developers."
26954,Clash Royale,"Used love game nowadays, supercell cares much money going pocket rather give. I lost 300 trophies lag would keep telling ""Clash Royale responding."" Happens every day, piss poor"
26955,Clash Royale,"I absolutely LOVE game addictive, exciting quite lot time tense! But PLEASE let clan wars clan amount players I heard update coming amount excitement iv'e EVER I find 10 MEMBERS ALL level 8 please let everyone clan 3 members level required. Also please respond Supercell SOMETHING. Thank do! Yours Sincerely Black knight (a clash Royale player)"
26956,Clash Royale,"I hated win battles continuous defeat cheat, they give higher level opponents attack damages decreases defeat means showing us losers, hack, cheat I like clash royale... Otherwise good."
26957,Clash Royale,"awesome game... fun, exciting, and.. never dull moment.... like game goes changes, and, always stays fresh.... thing think of, is.. needs comprehensive process recovering previous games transitioning via device change.... maybe, system, which.. old device required, to, authorize said recovery; .. know, new device..... that.. great game!....."
26958,Clash Royale,"Pay win - unable enjoy game there's players spend money game. Unfair matchmaking - can't even count many times got paired player thats 4 levels me. If could give zero, would. If want loose patience even install."
26959,Clash Royale,"Clan chest needs brought back, clan war enough way force buying tokens upgrade normally used cards. Begining less interested game week. At least clan war chest receive 1 card thats primary deck thats never case. You've turned fun game wanted play daily even want try anymore."
26960,Clash Royale,"The game great I playing couple years, guys yet solved problem matching opponents unequal levels. You guys sa really focus this. I lvl11 suddenly I get matched lvl12 sometimes even lvl13. The troop level difference difficult come over."
26961,Clash Royale,"2v2 system su**s, 20 games played none able win. Always 2 opponents lvl 11-12 vs lvl 8-9... Really? It used 5 star, playing year I started days ago. I might stop playing again."
26962,Clash Royale,The placement system broken. I put troops spot spawns somewhere completely different. The cards two overpwered. AND TO TOP IT OFF YOU SWITCHED THE CARDS TO DIFFERENT ARENAS SO NOW I DONT HAVE A CHANCE AT GETTING CARDS I WANT AND NEED.
26963,Clash Royale,"Despite people say, p2w. I mean, even enemy higher card levels, still beat using strategy good card combos. On 2nd account I pushed trophies lvl 8, got 3500. If strategy, versatile cards, won. Sometimes I get frustrated p2w players usually strategy easily defended play cards right. 5/5. Well done Supercell, well done."
26964,Clash Royale,This game gets worse worse. The reason I play still I've invested much time money. Anyone considering starting game shouldn't. Just stop. Go something else. Don't spend money upgrading cards developers nerf cards ground whim. The Meta purposely set hard get cards spend hundreds become competitive.
26965,Clash Royale,"This game definitive pay-to-win game. The matchmaking system worst I've seen gaming. I used put dollars game regularly well designed fun Supercell's unwillingness keep game fair means I spend another dime. Not mention new nickel diming, including gems arena packs anymore."
26966,Clash Royale,"Oh I sorry, I wrote previous review bit softly (see below). This time ""best wishes"": Hopefully guys choke meal, everytime eat filthy food! Where balance? You idiots ruined game.. 9 10 I keep loosing everyday.. Can't even make chest... Uninstalling it.."
26967,Clash Royale,"I addicted. Fun, challenging, infuriating. This I said 2016 I still stuck arena 11. The competition ridiculously high matching system totally broken. I create new deck, win three row lose 4 row. This game broken now. Supercell want progress want stuck spot match weak players top tier mfers. I'm done."
26968,Clash Royale,"UPDATE .. You guys REALLY need something people leaving 2v2 matches. penalty, took away. People leaving matches gotten hand! I 5 stars, now, gets fixed, I've rated 3. Fix issue ASAP."
26969,Clash Royale,I really like meet new people talk friends. It also challenging game came make clan join one. There sorts stuff get like troops chests bye them. Check game build troops up.
26970,Clash Royale,Well matching system 1 v1s needs work opinion. Clash Royale still lots offer events 2 v2s play without fear losing trophies. While collecting cards grinding trophies pain lost battle easily bring full tilt. Clash Royale fun way.
26971,Clash Royale,Updated game block 2v2 matches bad player conduct. You get punished leaving match early even teammate stops playing. I've supported game well years. I donating anymore.
26972,Clash Royale,"Its Ok! I Rated 3 Star Because I Have Lot Time Spend Play Clash Royale Chest Slots Is Dumb Only 4 Chests? And Only I You Can Open Every 4,8,12,Hours 1 Day?"
26973,Clash Royale,"I game 2 years I level 12. I tried linking game gmail would make make new account. A year ago phone broke I struggled retrieve game data, I got SIM card memory I believe. Now I new phone can't retrieve data! I paid roughly $100 account gone."
26974,Clash Royale,I would give 5 star constant unfair match ups ridiculous! Between constant crappy pair ups 2v2 bad. The moment find great deck run go change card stats grind forever find new deck. Fun game aggravating. Just pay anything game. Not worth it!
26975,Clash Royale,The emotes pleasing all. The older implementations better. Another thing matchmaking single player. An absolute nightmare. Getting matched higher level opponents cards I discovered yet gives huge advantage. Frustrating. This easily fixable programming configuration. Match players players similar decks. And levels. This screams pay win.
26976,Clash Royale,"I casual player, two years playing, I decided remove game. The unfair match players ruines game. How disappointed saw opponent player uses cards two levels higher you?"
26977,Clash Royale,"The game fair all. I playing game 2 years yet I can't get useful legendary cards upgrade legendaries. Moreover, friends started play get legendaries easily. At least week. I getting legendaries long time. Hope supercell fix balance game."
26978,Clash Royale,Get rid play bans. There's already much put game. Im gonna delete actively stopping playing I disconnect twice. Or least lower it? An hour eternity mobile game.
26979,Clash Royale,Horrible play win game everyone cards can't get reach higher arena. You get match pay win people time.. higher level people camp low level arena I'm level 8 I match level 10 higher time I never game someone lower level
26980,Clash Royale,"This games matchmaking joke. Its supposed random I always get put someone higher level me, someone always perfect counter deck somebody cards way higher level mine. It's ridiculous. The chests give worst cards rarely get cards deck. Its turning pay win game. Just like clash clans. Supercell got greedy. That's easy see. This needs fixed Once matchmaking gets tuned might alright. I'm level 10 facing level 12s 13s. Come on."
26981,Clash Royale,"Used love game. After latest patch, every single game last 30 second sudden death trouble placing troops. When tried place card, card come play 3-4 seconds later made droped 4k4 4k1. And no, internet perfectly fine, unless say clash royale requires stronger connection league legends blade soul shadowgun legend."
26982,Clash Royale,This game lot fun run balance issues. Some cards exceptionally strong lucky enough find almost bound lose. Nightwitch card hard counter acquire instantly disadvantage similar cards. Good idea making people pay good cards want fun win me.
26983,Clash Royale,"It clearly designed addictive, is. It good mobile game. Once playing however clearly pay win game. The game rewards bad players dump money game rather skillful play. It worst matchmaking I ever seen. Get ready play people whose cards way strong absolutely chance winning."
26984,Clash Royale,I've game now. It's good works. However whenever I try challenge participate war starts load finally shows game already started I'm usually tower. I know people problem really annoying sucks fun it.
26985,Clash Royale,"This game favorite time. 5/5, problem I I'm 2v2 friend. Sometimes glitched I'm stuck loading menu cant cancel. Is way fix that?"
26986,Clash Royale,"This game highly leveraged towards pay (a lot) win. Continued ""balance changes"" new cards screw prior developmental investment. Card level (i.e. ability spend real money) thing matters high levels. Players toxic game continues slip rankings. I HIGHLY suggest find non Supercell game play."
26987,Clash Royale,"UPDATED REVIEW: This game used solid many ""directional glitches"" towards outcome fight. Game geared make spend money progress higher levels, based pure skill using cards opponents. System purposely position higher level card players deck random position opponent counter. This adventure game skill game battles randomly decided system."
26988,Clash Royale,Great game please put option change name profiles least time select new name ourselves. I think bit unfair name whole game. At least add option change name time (total 2 times). Thanks.
26989,Clash Royale,Golem strong. You made royal recruits impossible use. The targeting system actually garbage. I see targeting something farther away instead closest troop. I see troops ignore another troop right front run right attack tower. Ridiculously bad targeting.
26990,Clash Royale,"I like extended extra time normal match. 3 minutesis long heavily favour expensive deck. Now players hold back extra time spam rocket lightning double elixir time long. It fun, especially player low elixir deck. Please bring back 1 minute extra time normal match."
26991,Clash Royale,Amazing game battle players inside outside clan. The thing I disliked game en certain level clan tournaments. I playing game year I still love it. This game great way spend time IF YOU HAVE WIFI.
26992,Clash Royale,Warning new players !!! game playable anymore cheaters using Fast elixir cheat always opponents . It's frustrating always lost via cheat. think deliberate force buy cards supercell. I think deliberate scam supercell always favoring people buys giving faster elixiir dont buy. So youre looking fair play game look games paid play overwhelming advantages
26993,Clash Royale,Need option lower graphics low end smartphones could handle game without lag. Please it.... Update: 2v2 teammate left battle I also left battle. Now saying I'm blocked 1 hour quick match.
26994,Clash Royale,"This favorite game 2 years! Until last update! It went Clash Royale Cash Royale! Their greed gotten best them! Now I can't even get response player support! I brought issue support rep & gave answer true. When I told correct asked question ""explanation"", response ignored erased! 3 times, fact, questions ignored & erased without courtesy reply! For first time long time I'm looking new game!"
26995,Clash Royale,problems game global chat like clash clans hard clan leaders like recruit active members. war system flawed. many people I know like new war system. could much better
26996,Clash Royale,"CR good game good game. I would treat 5 stars rating 3 stars two reasons. First , I getting good cards like Elite barbarians I want. Second , I reached till Hog mountain yet I got 14 cards legendaries specially lumberjack I. So I would rate 5 stars I got cards mentioned"
26997,Clash Royale,"This sorry exuse game another ""Free play, pay win"" game. Ive game since day one, COC, Boom beach, every time feel like im getting somewhere, lovely supercell decides add new teirs game, physically impossible get without spending real money. Total waste time. I could without kids using parents credit cards. Money well wasted lazy creators game rest crappy series."

And SUPER CELL favour search friends names also tag no. ( available ). plz favour really nice game..... also chat friends global clan . another icon

27001,Clash of Clans,I love it. Just thing. Whats green archer towers. Th12 theme blue? Another thing think people go effort upgrading heroes less regeneration time instead higher levels. The time decrease higher go. More spells troops would appreciated. Great game keep good work
27002,Clash of Clans,This game amazing. I've playing years surpassed 6th year anniversary. The support admin wonderful questions answered quickly. The graphics great simple. Of course game promise every problem able solved. Game development harder think. There ads wonderful game free-to-play. The game quick load unless slow internet/data big update came out.
27003,Clash of Clans,#SuperCellRocks ☆☆☆☆☆ My older brother (Robie) introduced November 2017. Our father passed away 11/1/2018. He playing cell I let tablet could see phenomenal graphics better .

27008,Clash of Clans,Even though new player find game dynamic challenging takes long time get enjoy perks seasoned players get enjoy. Ive playing 4 years see updates part reach geared toward top level players only. I however continue play.
27009,Clash of Clans,Good game. Way much money play catchup. Takes long build. You could spend couple hundred bucks catching friends easy. If want skip buy everything right cost least 20 grand kind game Cost kind money. Games great. Highway robbery. There people clan spend hundreds month. A good playstation game costs 60 bucks. Think it. Play clash buy in. Too addicting !!!
27010,Clash of Clans,Superb Time kill game. It improves mind power & make u think new traps & attack's. You learn strategy player computing them!

28938,ConnectLine,"Hearing streamer Nobody can't understand useful hearing aid? The person can't hear clearly right position using hearing aid every single time everywhere. This streamer helpful impairing hear also. I'm always using time hearing aid cuz help receiving call, listening music video put volume high low hearing aid."
28939,ConnectLine,"Usable, really suitable Galay Y (GT-S5360). Various elements user interface overflow screen, although I found anything least partially screen. Also tin information page headings overlapping details. Won't install SD card, device memory starved already difficult update built stuff insists going internal memory. ""Disable Volume"" seems mean Enable Volume! The added value seems battery level reading ability set parameters normally set Genie. Identities paired connected devices would useful."
28940,ConnectLine,"Not bad app, needs work. It would nice override phone screen calling receiving call. While open, nice see battery level instead enter options. Also chance add personal ring tone built ringtones hard hear everyday noises. Overall, better nothing."
28941,ConnectLine,"I've owned pair Oticon Nera2 Ti two years now. Nearing warranty end. Both aids failed multiple times since purchase. Too much proprietary complication cripples limits something I own! Too many visits audiologist adjustments pairing devices. Too many faulty Nera 2's replaced faulty aids. Oticon 3 star big disappointments! My time belongs me, Oticon! I'm believer Oticon motto ""places people first"""
28942,ConnectLine,"Like it. If work you, likely need firmware update steamer. Don't rate low problem. Mine 1.0 audiologist updated 1.3. With working, I see controls streamer itself. There additional controls app. For example, I control whether I want also listen background noise not. So basically, I got controls I've wanting while."
28943,ConnectLine,Can't get pair streamer Verizon Galaxy s4 I tried two days get pair phone (or least recognize pairing). The phone pairs fine never recognizes streamer. I wasted lot time.
28944,ConnectLine,"It's okay. In need improvement My favorite feature ability presets environments (bar, movies, etc.) press button.

There's info set utilize app. Everything I found took time get used app."
28945,Contacts,"Got previous phone, connected Gmail account phone contacts/backup, like said to. O never wanted Google contacts sync show, didn't. Just got new phone, Google contacts sync (emails every email I've contacted), phone contacts I'd previously saved nowhere found. Where they? This garbage."
28946,Contacts,This waste time. All duplicate contacts gets updated line update WEB. If could find bug fix would good. My windows phone working perfect sinks correctly google contact. This means issue Contact Android.
28947,Contacts,"Google QUIT making anything money moronic ads! And leave useful care it. This WORST come professional organization.

Google product designers get thick heads everyone wants sync everything stupid email accounts."
28948,Contacts,I think bug something app. It makes multiple blank contacts contact name annoying. Also option delete multiple contacts selecting them. You open every contact delete it. Really frustrating. Please Resolve google. You big reputation keep.

28953,Contacts,"How possible seems Android phone impossible send email contact group (and even can't done email app, go contacts.) If possible, they've made undiscovered feature history design. Does anyone google actually apps??????"

Fields line properly Google Contacts online data. Why can't I display note data 1024 characters, apparently. Google online duplicated Google Contacts app...not done way...and sure why?? Should also take customized names directly Google Contacts online. So make sense create custom field names, since port over."

After get duplicates straightened out, go settings, go accounts, tap Google turn contact sync people sync accounts device. Next go settings, go apps, tick show system apps, tap contact storage clear data NOTE IF YOU HAVE DEVICE ONLY CONTACTS BACK THEM UP FIRST OR YOU WILL LOOSE THEM!!! Now turn back contact sync people sync open OEM contact manager. You may still end couple duplicates.

29184,Cooking Channel,"No idea why, seems like every time I want I uninstall reinstall ""authentication errors"", whatever hell means."
29185,Cooking Fever,"Was fun easy beginning. They know suck in, first level there's barely enough gems. By 2nd building I spending money I loved game. By third building, I realized I continue I started putting large chunks check it.... I stop I'm ahead. Got 3 buildings, halfway levels, back update gem problem"
29186,Cooking Fever,I really enjoyed game first. Finished first building without spending much gems all. Moved onto second building quickly realised I start spending gems without way earn without spending loads real cash quickly turned dead end game. Update. I completed second restaurant 2 stars most. I 50000 coins gems I can't start new upgrade current get stars. Have redo level order get gems buy new restaurant. Essentially stuck
29187,Cooking Fever,"The game play great. It's challenging good way. However, thing I can't stand success rate slot machine. I finished 2 restaurants already twice. One learning another 200 coins. I need jewels I money spend get wallet. And takes long level up. If slot machine better success rate, I would like game"
29188,Cooking Fever,"I know happened last update, lost automatic maker already bought gems. Just realized I want participate last challenge. I used really love game. The longest game ever play. Have play years now. Please fix automatic maker problem. Because kinda feel cheated now."
29189,Cooking Fever,"Absolutely love game. Very addicting challenging. No need buy gems, play casino every 24 hours using 500 coin button. If play 7 consecutive days receive 2 gems day every day that. Its challenging first couple months, keep playing dont buy. My concerns level 40 receive coins. It says every 5 levels receive coins. Also, update restraurant new chairs stuff, see play, like beach hut. Please fix this."
29190,Cooking Fever,Game superb addictive continue game need many gems sufficient. Mainly every upgrade need many gems earning process gems less get two ways first level up(7 gems) playing daily (2 gems) put atleast 20 gems every kitchen upgrade.I hope gems problem solve next upgrade keeping coins uptown second upgrade keeping less gems.
29191,Cooking Fever,"Recently updated. Now On-line only?! Why?! I used enjoy playing waiting appointments travelling. Extremely disappointing. Oh well, I guess I get play much more. It's good game worth data charges!"
29192,Cooking Fever,Just downloaded every 1 minute comes internet lost server lost. And ive using data play game.. whats happening there. Please fix im getting mad
29193,Cooking Fever,I absolutely loved the game. Spent lot money lol. I got new phone played year. I'm really hoping transfer progress since email all. We shall see.
29194,Cooking Fever,"I've fun playing 3 months, latest update tanked enjoyment. I get server problem errors, progress rolled back several times. The timing daily play rewards changed casino operating well. This first game I really spent time on, I give it."
29195,Cooking Fever,This game fun play. Now game malfunctions time! I emailed developer problems game play. I'm still waiting reply. I've spent much money game work randomly all. Also game progress really saved account despite saving account.
29196,Cooking Fever,It's fun would much better slide food spend money restaurant upgrades well food upgrades. Also gem situation sucks cause need many upgrades earn little. Not fun enough pay real money
29197,Cooking Fever,"It great overall. I'd recommend friend! Great game addicting. Maybe make ways get gems people get game quicker I personally impatient, disorder makes shiver move. So suggest quicker way."
29198,Cooking Fever,"I loved game playing almost 2 years so. Then I go sign today tells things adjusted roll back. Which meant automatic items I bought kitchens gone. All gems I spent wasted. This ridiculous. If things changed soon, I never play game again."
29199,Cooking Fever,Horrible company. My child accidentally purchased gems $99.99 care help reverse it. Instead rep practically called lier. It matter I'd playing 5 years. Don't load game company JOKE!
29200,Cooking Fever,"It fun game, I'm going lie. But pay, pay, pay pay more. I dumped enormous amounts $$ game. Every level pay last. So yes fun, unless super rich. Don't bother. I going uninstall game, I can't aford finish it."
29201,Cooking Fever,"First level easy reward coins gems upgrades. 2nd level little harder They try get u buy coins gems, pass easier 3rd level impossible without buying gems upgrade stuff. So even bother playing even make able unless u spend loads gems. Which thrn annoying u may prev spent small amounts level 2. Just quit u get far in. Waste time. Shame game good game."
29202,Cooking Fever,"I love game favorite atm! There's restaurant, bakery, sports bar, hells kitchen compete game more. So far I've unlocked bought bakery addition restaurant everyone starts with. Not well ☺."
29203,Cooking Fever,"Hey! Have played game? Well ok, maybe know really stressing. Like, i don't like controls wish everything auto could watch wen get food. And problem I wish would stand ever. So I give game 4 ten points!"
29204,Cooking Fever,"Before updated, good. After updated every automatic machine loss.. If automatic machine can't instal back purchase , uninstall game... Very angry.. Wasted time play"
29205,Cooking Fever,"This fun game couple days. Then progressing game becomes impossible without buying diamonds, premium currency. You cannot buy ANY new upgrades restaurants without it. There point playing anymore, rate unlock new things free diamonds give insanely slow unreasonable."
29206,Cooking Fever,It good game although dont get many gems. Then couple days ago opened game get daily login checked back later still not. Next day reset back day one. Used could check daily reward seems exactly 24 hours last. Also today get told error get rollback. Game getting cheap
29207,Cooking Fever,All amazing game. But recently alot problems seen. The servers respond. And irritating casino machine keeps rolling stop long time. You need fix please. There alot bugs.
29208,Cooking Fever,This game addictive! I can't stop playing it! And addictive I uploaded video today I playing this! I rate big 5 stars! It good graphics good game play I really recommend game gets bored easily.
29209,Cooking Fever,The grubbing gems ridiculous. I nearly max level items burger joint I special challenge putting lot gems. Turns cannot possibly beat without constantly refilling cupcakes costs gems. Such money grubbing BS kills game. Remove massive gem upgrades find different way get money...like ads reasonable gem costs
29210,Cooking Fever,I really enjoying game. Then I decide buy gems. BIG MISTAKE. MY GAME CRASHED yet YOU CHARGED MY ACCOUNT AND GAVE ME NO GEMS! I uninstalling recommending anyone !
29211,Cooking Fever,"Very good game, challenging times. Helps learn multitask sure. Need watch gem management want go far game. Worth paying I suppose, I would gladly watch ad two get extra gems."
29212,Cooking Fever,"Very addictive game lastest update terrible. Constant server responding, constant rollbacks removed automatic stuff cost lot gems. I purchased restaurants automatic machines. I 3 stars restaurants except newest. I never bought gems. With changes, I tell friends game!"
29213,Cooking Fever,"Ridiculously hard get gem buy them. Don't know u ask ppl rate yr game, u apparently listen. At least 90% r saying thing!!!!!! Id rate higher ud listen change this. Other wise, good game. Very addictive."
29214,Cooking Fever,"Easy figure out, really care company. They cheap rewards, get back say will, ever! The game recently blip said 2 days get back me, 5 minutes later another note, 4 days problem game, think they'd want top it."
29215,Cooking Fever,"I played game awhile issues, recently I accidentally switched profiles I switched back latest resturant I purchased 200,000 coins gone. I emailed customer support havent heard anything back. I'm frustrated I dont want purchase resturant I already part way already. Other great game little issues. I wish could options upgrades without always gems now, that's rare nowadays."
29216,Cooking Fever,"Actually good game. But always suddenly close. It annoys much. So can't continue game. It keeps telling there's discrepancy. I dunno that, please fix"
29217,Cooking Fever,"Everything going well I update. I enjoyed game immensely. Then I get message rollback due glitch.... Ok.... I soon realized automatic machines I worked hard get, could buy diamonds, we're GONE. WHAT IS GOING ON??? One machines cost 70 diamonds! Now I none. DO NOT DO THE UPDATE people reading review! I see comments update go well. Nordcurrent, please learn various feedbacks reverse ""rollback"" need online. Why necessary online before? Will uninstalling game issue can't fixed. Will also telling people I told game uninstall."
29218,Cooking Fever,"Hi. This game addicting fun! I played long time gained lot experience sadly day device stopped working I reinstalled phone, connected Google play account I could continue previous time I selected game completely restarted I lost progress sadly. I'm sure there's way fixing"
29219,Cooking Fever,"We need food survive. We nutrients within food fuel bodies. Our bodies nutrients create energy us, die. This random. I aware review makes sense. Gucci Gang Gucci Gang Boonk Gang Boonk Gang Oofer Gang Oofer Gang everyday bro wit dat lit flow. 420 blaze it. 360 noscope. I sorry wasting time. The game good btw. It's annoying I run diamonds, though. Keep good work!"

29223,Cooking Fever,Not sure happened game reset im guessing completed levels. Sucks. Waste time
29224,Cooking Fever,"I playing game years. Now sending rollbacks removing progress! I spent countless hours! They sabotage players. There way winning higher single gem row prize game casino. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME *** Update...they removed automatic cooking machines!!!***2nd update****I contact support device ID posting initial review, heard back. In fact, I getting rollbacks. Don't punish players game playing game long! Your support even respond!"
29225,Cooking Fever,"Was fun easy beginning. They know suck in, first level there's barely enough gems. By 2nd building I spending money I loved game. By third building, I realized I continue I started putting large chunks check it....... Full Review"
29265,Cooking Fever,"I've playing Cooking Fever many years. It's challenging, fast paced plain fun. I love addition Coke~Cola Gordon Ramsay. I can't think single downside Cooking Fever all."
29266,Cooking Fever,Since last update cant play game cause downloading giving error. Plz fix problem. Thx
29268,Cooking Fever,I would've give 5stars. But makes mad I spin try get diamonds hard impossible get 2-3of diamond things
29269,Cooking Fever,very addicting didn't give stars demand diamonds much u provide much diamond........ everybody dont want buy make ur fame worth played
29270,Cooking Fever,"I played game long time, game fun, especially play off-line mode liked used. I give high rate game addicting fun. But Now, In on-line mode I get server problem many times...It's annoying me..."
29271,Cooking Fever,"I REALLY like game, recently become soo nerve - racking!!! When I'm trying grab food, I can't! So customers getting annoyed I can't pass level. I idea why. My sister problem. So I hope temporary mistake, fix soon. I problem 3 days"
29272,Cooking Fever,On level 13 customer even accept anything even order. This really annoying causes I can't get pass level 13 cause
29273,Cooking Fever,"I adding review saying READ ALL THE COMMENTS. I alone. Don't play unless want pay! This unfair, frustrating game I played thus far. I played years ago thought I would try again. Even reset try different strategies. Nope! Only fun want PAY!PAY!PAY! I say...NO WAY! UNINSTALL!! waist time. It's fun first absolutely everything takes gems. And rude noises make irritating AF!"
29274,Cooking Fever,"It's pretty silly everything takes gems obtaining gems drawn out. I like game seems I can't levels get harder, experience gems goes up, I get anything update gems. Even couple gems day would nice coming back. There ton cooking games fun, however gets frustrating can't advance much I'm pay foe gems ton free games I pick choose from."
29275,Cooking Fever,"This pretty fun initially. I made food court quickly, upgrading/new buildings requires bajillion gems I purchase. Beware challenges!! I leveled get gems challenge found I cannot get past level three purely due tip amount and/or lack cupcakes, interior everything except disco ball. No gems means disco ball improvement challenge means gems gone. Getting gems ridiculous kills progress interest."
29276,Cooking Fever,I really enjoy game. Lately getting unable connect try again. Every game I play works fine. Recently lost 300 plus days game play. Sad say may say good bye game :-(
29277,Cooking Fever,The controls horrible. When I try place something warmer food burns.
29278,Cooking Fever,"Sometimes there's periods game lags painfully long time, that's aggravating me. Other that, game quite enjoyable fun play bored."
29279,Cooking Fever,I like game. It's addictive. Though guys stingy gems. I played available restaurants. How come I can't see available sale? I played 8 far.
29280,Cooking Fever,Iedit: getting jewels pain. I'm paying get Jewels 20 dollars. I'd rather watch ads. Game would fun I could farm gold
29281,Cooking Fever,Very addictive game got something gem situation. I playing game 2 years on.. I go lose interest enough gems buy anything.
29283,Cooking Fever,"Great game. I personally think hard get diamonds. I've unlocked 93% restaurants completed levels spent cent A reasons I dropped 5 3 stars. First I think actually get 2 3 diamond lines casino. I think pretty dishonest slots they're impossible actually get. Second last update, game freeze mid level say server crashed. This perfect data signal."
29284,Cooking Fever,"This best games I ever played, well, best MOBILE games I've played, Soda Dungeon. Highly advise both, that's for.This game great customization gameplay. For me, I love easy games, I love game even more. It's like stupid cooking game, unique. Thank game fact still updating it."
29285,Cooking Fever,"Normally I don,t play games much. But game ..I became addictive game. It's really nice. The concern is, gain gems finish levels three stars. We cannot buy every time need"
29286,Cooking Fever,"Controller handy, kinda old fashion way still need swipe food manually. Feels like forcing spend money buying gems. I tried day uninstalled it."
29287,Cooking Fever,Played game 3 years. Love yes I've spent money gems nothing crazy. BUT I downloaded new restaurant previous restaurants could purchase around level 29 30 automatic machine help out. It time gems I left I saving that. Anyone else problem game makers quit offering it?
29288,Cooking Fever,"Very frustrating game. Such fun game, I stuck without spending actual money. I four restaurants, none I completely finish without diamonds. I buy would costly. I've already spent $50,000 game dollars slot machine win diamonds NONE. Deleting recommend unless want spend real money."
29289,Cooking Fever,On devices play Hours nothing good competitive fun I wish diamonds easier earn locations unlocked easier unlock casino rip I never win
29290,Cooking Fever,Why drawback game??? I upgraded 100% upgrading made 35%.what This?
29291,Cooking Fever,I can't believe it! Phone got broken bought new transferred everything new phone. Once I opened I lost progress!! There's way save level continue left off. No way I starting again. Uninstalled.
29292,Cooking Fever,"The game fun addicting. However, sometimes game progress rollback, Its quite annoying cause keep losing progress worked hard making again."
29293,Cooking Fever,You guys rolled back progress stating found discrepancy progress... You guys gave free coins offer upgraded quickly... Now found discrepancy.... Keep game
29294,Cooking Fever,"It awesome game I gave update, internet game full time. Can't play game get daily gems internet. So stupid. Why guys need make EVERY GAME A FULL TIME INTERNET GAME? Not everybody afford data/internet/wifi every single day. It sucks, game fine messed up! I want game back way please"
29295,Cooking Fever,"A good game does not make much of a talent or game, but it is also a game of love for you. Please do not forget to thank you for playing the game. 5 star dain sakain love love love love"
29297,Cooking Fever,"wrong.. yesterday play offline..now need online??? always something even without internet, dislike"

29302,Cooking Fever,"Very addictive game, I like playing I think fair win gems gambling I win singular gem ones 2 & 3 gems"
29303,Cooking Fever,"I love playing game like many others said hard get gems without spending money, makes frustrating.. There way could get gems easily trade coins gems!! One problem I game customer/tech support. awful continue give run around. I played game roughly 280 day row collecting 2 gems day daily reward, day decided give daily reward instead put back day 1 get gems day 7 (this happened several times me). I contacted customer/ tech support nothing help resolve issue make right, instead kept telling fault likely issue device time altered. First I NEVER mess settings phone issue, I traveling different time zones. want admit glitch game.. great game, need gem opportunities, better tech support!"
29304,Cooking Fever,"The game fun. HOWEVER, first restaurant, every place WILL need kitchen\interior upgrades order pass level, impossible without matter skill. And upgrades WILL need diamonds. You get diamonds often enough game. So I believe forcing pay... I hate games force pay order simply move forward. Could've great game. But I'm finding tempted uninstall"
29305,Cooking Fever,"You guys issued ""roll back"" discrepancies, I lost PAID FOR automatic cooking machines. I get reimbursement almost 100 gems! Please issue."
29306,Cooking Fever,"Update: changing game ""online game"" sucks, need game online. I data phone I can't time... Change game online game:( *(old review) Beat game ever, I play hours."

29312,Cooking Fever,"I love everything game, fact absolutely spend money buy gems advance ridiculous. Will back ever changes."
29313,Cooking Fever,Love game recd two gems daily. I trying get three stars happening. Starting get fed now.
29314,Cooking Fever,"It's fun game, make dang near impossible get 3 stars levels unless spend money gems earn many game play. They incorporate ways earn gems without spending real money."
29315,Cooking Fever,It's really addictive game... So much fun play. But beginning thereafter getting difficult & interest towards lacks

I like idea challenges tournaments please fix tournament I start every time I leave game I already completed 3 levels. People lives jobs,making us start left game wrong. Thank you. Sadly I change stars give less. This used playable offline well as,online. Then nowhere,with warning,you changed online only. I used game pass time long car rides. Please make game available offline again, thank you."
29320,Cooking Fever,The game expensive. To complete restaurant Need much costs go restaurant. And dozens. I wasted $2 lied special. Cost twice price gems got dessert I need. Money hungry game. Not another cent. There many cooking games scalp you. Go there.
29321,Cooking Fever,It's fun playing it. But coins come fast should.
29322,Cooking Fever,"It really good game, annoyingly hard rare get gems incredibly necessary progress. Tired open game every day get even I can't 'play'."
29323,Cooking Fever,Tired NEVER EVER even slight chance getting full set 2 gems (30) let alone 3 set (50). Playing almost 3 years aside fake scam hacks I've never heard anyone getting them. Can't believe many gems needed upgrades. They really need reduce greed make game gems obtainable. Just spent 200K cash last month get 60 gems
29324,Cooking Fever,"Amazing!! Would definitely recommend want something do. Very challenging, makes fun!! AAHHH HELP ME I'M ADDICTED"
29325,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"It's totally ok want get money develop game, maybe better create option us decide; like games. They make levels impossible pass want force buy gems. You pass levels unless spend lot gems!!"
29327,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"I love game. This game really fair. I mean, got star bility. Other games commercial forced gamers buy things. And like games, game pretty much hard get 3 stars.. I also enjoy game advanture.. Many theme restaurant dive. Peace out."
29328,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,Great game. My complaint sometimes finished food item nothing happens make go customer. This really mess flow.
29329,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"Very addictive yet funnnnn & food delicious! Just little bit frustrated wait energy recharge. But rest, superb! The important is, lot restaurants & levels! I like thanks!"
29330,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"This game sucks!! I feel I need start game I able that. Now I stuck level, I enough jewels go on. So what, I never play game again??!! Why let people start game over. Really pissed off!!!!"
29331,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"TOTALLY ADDICTING. I can't stop playing! It's fun challenging! I really love energy deplete per level do, depletes fail level. It's great mechanic!"
29332,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"You HAVE buy extra time customers complete level point fun game. I enjoyed I got stuck level, I equipment upgraded completed orders seconds collect enough money without additional time customers. Also get equipment costs that's ridiculous"
29333,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"I love game level make completely impossible pass without using jewels. For example says need serve 30 people give 28 people. It's timing I serve people gone next person comes I still 28 people. And another thing cash says make $1,250 cash I get like $1,240 even though everyone left happy I meant happy fix issue I give stars"
29334,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,Got two days ago. First 31 levels great began shutting 15 minutes 10 play. They blocked rating game. Had uninstall reload. That's shameful. If make user friendly I give friendly rating. Try Township playrix. They never shut various games within game.
29335,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"Unlike games, squeeze dry. The prices in-app purchases affordable want purchase, simply overcome patience, extra hard work tactics, diamonds easily gained daily log-in. The levels indeed challenging manageable. They make impossible to-beat level make purchase something. Very recommended!"
29336,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,I loved game first levels become impossible beat without spending real money. Uninstalling I advise downloading unless want get frustrated
29337,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,This really fun game...very time consuming. I downloaded stopped playing. I love trying new games I played really fun playing. Since I downloaded game I stopped playing...I even forgot games I playing.
29338,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,This teaches quick make sure focus much I call relaxing I call regular relaxing fine awesome fun play
29339,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,They pretty much force jewels point making impossible pass. I've ran money jewels UNINSTALL next game.
29340,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"I think amazing. It could stressful, I really enjoyed it! This favorite apps. Good job!!"
29341,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"This fun, easy play game. You touch cooked steak drink goes customer. You change beer iced tea sodas kids people like beer."
29343,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,I really liking game far. But exact cooking fever sure developers
29344,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,I think fun game hard parts...impossible get pass levels...stuck atm l need time!! So getting pretty frustrated..
29345,Cooking Madness - A Chef's Restaurant Games,"Sadly, I rate 3 stars I finished game 2 months ago still update? It's great game that's addictive I've run levels play taking space phone. PLEASE add levels!!"

Because callback number I speak operator five offices I go know doctor called force closes everytime I voicemail may never heard. I may never upset life I right now!!"
30746,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Doesn't always pop get voice mail. If call hear messages, change unread / unheard messages none. And big one.... What adventure see thinks heard turned text. Oh boy. Comedic, really. If cellular companies provide decent visual voicemail, can't cricket? Also, try listening VM app. If message 3 seconds, lucky get listening whole message. It cut off, start again. Come guys, fix this!"
30747,Cricket Visual Voicemail,Problems lately. A couple updates ago started pausing playback 4 second mark. That corrected. A couple days ago update broke voicemail completely--couldn't access voicemail visual dial-in way. Resetting password corrected that. The July 2 update broke again. 3 stars generous.
30748,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Only Sprint good speech-to-text algorithm gets 99% words correct. Cricket version unreliable. Touch Sensitivity screen poor. I must touch speaker button least twice make operate. The play button plays seconds stops, I must press again. Usually play button causes speaker button turn off."
30749,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"The responsive, I touch play button many times order hear voicemails. Also voicemails stop halt way hit play button keep hearing message."
30750,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Not responsive touch time stops playing multiple times playback. I think voicemail fast enough show progress indicator, know what's happening press play multiple times. Speaker turns playback pauses."
30751,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"It never transcribes voicemail messages. In addition, I tap controls twice every time I get work. After tapping speakerphone option twice, tapping play button twice, message stops playing seconds unknown reason. This latest update installed."
30752,Cricket Visual Voicemail,Doesn't translate well mine... The text telling something way different actual voicemail. Also freezes playing voicemail back. I give two stars potential
30753,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"My S5 Active Android 4.4.2 NOT refresh VM anymore current VVM app. I call hear new VM. My father S5A Android 6, delay play problems everybody else reporting. If many people problems new version, can't roll back prior version worked fix new?"
30754,Cricket Visual Voicemail,used work flawlessly. Now I get notifications new VM app. I open refresh see new voicemails. It also randomly stops playback listening messages.
30755,Cricket Visual Voicemail,They rolled back previous crappy version. Messages stop playing seconds double tap every button work: press every button two times play pause put speaker even press back. How difficult make button press command?
30756,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"For simple app, still manages barely functional. Most actions require hitting associated button multiple times registers. If speaker turned on, ALWAYS pauses playback two seconds in, requiring hit play button resumes playback. SO something basic playing message speaker takes 20 taps three buttons."
30757,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Good needs work. Hate starts playing 3 seconds quits playing voicemail. like double tap voicemail button speaker icon go speaker phone, single tap."
30758,Cricket Visual Voicemail,Wish could set custom notification sound. I get messages delayed I get I pick phone see notification heard nothing. The worst part even work half time. I get notification cell visual voice mail alerted nothing I manually launch give seconds check servers. works wants to. I'm better checking voicemail cell regular way relay app. Maybe push notifications work right app... Junk.
30759,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"This awful. Every single time either wife I try listen voicemail (on completely different phones) stops playing first 3-4 seconds, that's assuming connect voicemail begin with. I would much rather forward VM Google Voice, course Cricket wants force awful VM app."
30760,Cricket Visual Voicemail,The last update rendered several steps back functionality. Messages stop playing several times playback I hit play button several times hear entire message. It also turns speaker I hit button several times buttons respond app.
30761,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"7/12 Fed up. Disabled abhorrent app. 7/11 update. Still horrid. Syncs messages now, error messages gone. screws Bluetooth connectivity ringer volume setting. Also multiple key presses still needed messages stop playing back mid-stream. I still consider totally broken hate 1 star. 7/2 update. Let's see works. Error messages seem gone now. Hope fixed. Will update review fully tested. Totally broken update. No connectivity cannot completed time error messages. After previous update, full annoying bugs. Get thing fixed right now, garbage."
30762,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Piss poor app. Touch response retarded, meaning touch button three four times something finally happens. When finally start playing voice messages, 6 seconds, cuts there. You touch Play button three four times message playback resumes cut off. Also, never refreshes new voice messages unless tell to, another process takes 10 seconds initiate retarded, non-responsive GUI. I've Cricket. I'm jumping Project Fi."
30763,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"IDK guys ""updated"" it, I can't even check messages now. Everytime I try refresh I keep getting ""no connectivity"". The useless I go back old way checking voicemails. I hope y'all fix even though anything impressive designed least. Update: I delete today decided see guys fixed problem have! Which good despite flaws I like working. So three stars instead one! :)"
30764,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"The stop playback turn speaker 4 seconds error back, along play/stop indicators work message count simply update third forth try: (all fixed; Well broken, again, early July 2018) SERIOUSLY FOLKS? HOW TOUGH IS IT? THIS HAS ONE FUNCTION, MANAGE VOICE MAIL. used work, every update broken. Core functionality guys: Not useless features. The used work fine. Stop messing"
30765,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"The issue I notice voicemails always stop first time try play hit play again, sort annoying. The proximity sensor bug fixed. I like voice text able access voicemails without dialing in."
30766,Cricket Visual Voicemail,The plays voicemail although automatically detect new voicemail. I manually refresh see new voicemail. Sadly buttons require two presses respond. This still true latest July update broken end June. Transcription longer works all. Sadly new bug caller ID rapidly changes phone number description.
30767,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Hard believe simple badly designed. The play back kept pausing apparent reason. The speaker. Keep getting turned every time resume (because got paused reason) . every time select voice mail, play without touching play button."
30768,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"It nice while, seems abandoned broken state. 1) I longer get voicemail notifications I open app. Not particularly useful. 2) Only first 2-3 seconds play audio randomly pauses, resume. It consistent, extremely annoying. 3) I think I've transcriptions months."
30769,Cricket Visual Voicemail,Usually issues this. But lately crashing.
30770,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"As today, still broken - press ""Play"" button multiple times start playback, playback stops 5 seconds I press Play again... Also, ""proximity sensor"" deafult sensitive, must disabled app's settings make less aggravating."
30771,Cricket Visual Voicemail,SUPER SLOW. Buggy. Have press play twice get message play stops 4 second press play again. Same thing speaker. It used work fine last months terrible.
30772,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Update good. Was working perfectly prior. Now, requires two touches play, stop, anything else playback screen."

30778,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"I thought I many problems I upgrade Samsung S9 Plus, Cricket updated yet. And I looked reviews. Now I'm convinced developers Cricket!!"
30779,Cricket Visual Voicemail,work! Does transcribe voicemails takes several tries even listen voicemails
30780,Cricket Visual Voicemail,It takes ever actually read play button hit plays 3 seconds pauses every damn time. speaker button hit like 4 times activate!
30781,Cricket Visual Voicemail,For bizarre reason since last update quit closes attempt message heard I days worth messages I can't receive
30782,Cricket Visual Voicemail,Horrendous! It takes several presses start playing. Then stops couple seconds another couple presses get start again. It takes several presses get switch speaker. Then start missed part message turns speaker
30783,Cricket Visual Voicemail,"Message pauses every time 2 3 seconds, hit every button least twice respond. This complaint Cricket, voicemail sucks bad."

30874,Crossy Road,"It's amazing fun game but, reason I rated 3 stars safety problem. Why need cess phone calls? That's creepy. It makes feel like creator games lisining I talk."
30875,Crossy Road,"Some reviewers got carried away one. Pretty simple game without much depth. Good great. Some flaws free play aspects. Sometimes go watch video get game credits, mistap ""x"" button close ad give credits (they take play store try get another game app). Also, sometimes ads show foreign languages. The art style good sound effects funny. Decent map character variety. If like free play game fine, make fan free play games."

30882,Crossy Road,I really loved game much favorite games time gives free gifts unfortunately thing I really like give duplicate character ton character I complaining I still love game much
30883,Crossy Road,Such great game! Played hours almost every character. It get bit laggy I asked developers fix lag did. I recommend game everyone I meet!

I issue making rate 5 I like u get duplicates I spend ages trying get coins I get duplicate annoying times taken game I happily rate 5.i like adds unless u choose watch money.
30885,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Great app. Works like charm me. Main complaint people seem can't get content ad free. Well pay rather cheap subscription fee problem. No ads. That's side watching anime legally. It printed much that's costs In time via ads cold hard cash. I truly enjoy anime I'll pay small fee support it.
30886,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I'm pretty sure fix buffering freezing issues mobile I'll keep two star. Several issues multiple devices need fixed issue mentioned also playback reset issues wii u mobile. Crunchy roll good pc sometimeish Xbox ps anything else, better using another methods ."
30887,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Love I pay premium content cause I much choice WiFi blocking every free site. Anyway, issue I fact half time, videos even load properly. When do, works like charm times, I'm forced go back onto queue onto video again. Please sort issue."
30888,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"The made watching anime course, issue lies trying TO watch them. Their quality setting, youre stuck trying load videos high quality; including advertisements. Its debatableif 'skip ad' button even works properly, seems compensate skip ad button adding ads skip. The easy finding sorting animes explore watch, even sorting categories intrested genre type exploration"
30889,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"It many ads. I'm fine free user needs watch ads while. But playing 4-6 ads time crazy! If I needed to, I'm fine watching 2-3 ads free anime 4 time much. It add 16-24 ads per episode. Crunchyroll premium, I think I pay I get ambushed ads. But quality anime still nice."
30890,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love app! And I love I watch anime free. The reason ISNT FIVE STARS I can't watch next episode next comes out! Its fine like can't watch right released, want get premium watch wait 4 days? But no! I rate 5 stars, recommend friends I wait days watch newest ep! Please!!!!!"
30891,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Its decent. Nice quality. Almost never buffer. Exept ads big issue here. I got ad literally played 14 minute video unbox therapy. I understand conpanies need make money all. But dont think need see 15-20 ads per episode. It took almost month finish sword art online. Without ads would taken less two weeks.
30892,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love content Crunchyroll they're competing sites like Funimation, Hulu, Netflix. They absolutely need step streaming game. I can't go episode without freezing disconnecting Chromecast. And auto play feature never worked me. There's many shows I'd like watch headache try. I really want love I watch even episode way through, I'll keep using services."
30893,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"As lover anime, I love product provide. I get watch favorite shows great low price. However price definitely reflects quality received subscription. I can't tell many times I've disappointed server, ease access quality life problems xbox phone apps. It would behoove take page netflix's book. -A disappointed customer"
30894,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,I get sort things need ads create revenue creators watch 26 minutes ads watch 5 minutes show bombarded ads bit much. Im perfectly ok ads ive found cool stuff im busy guy dont hour watch episode 20 minute show
30895,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Great place good quality anime, quality bad either. But really throw ads came write review getting literally non-stop ads- close application. I started watching 2 minutes first episode series too... At least let us watch giving us ads please. Edited:i reopened try watch again, kept giving ads like watching previously, can't watch anything right now. Don't know bug something can't watch want watch all."
30896,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Downloaded try service. I mind paying premium want know I'm getting. First two episodes played fine including ads (it's free all). Third episode, I can't get past first ads without screen going black responding. Can't fast forward, can't restart, can't watch anything. Great anime selection too. Fix maybe people actually pay it."
30897,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,So I like I want like I see way within choose dubbed option even anime I know dub for. This simple process changing setting somewhere. Yet option seems missing entirely app. Please either make choose dub reason find it. Put reasonable location like settings button video stream itself. Thanks.
30898,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Warning Android devices. Crunchy servers can't load videos Android. Video pause video sound go back ten seconds, I guess reloading. Keeps entire time. 20min episode lasts 40min. They need delete say stream PC console.... even console video quality go , even hard line. I guess using 20 year old servers"
30899,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Yea... I pay premium membership phone ps4 work properly time. I weeks content missing updated episode list atm even open (phone app). Ps4 almost never wants fully load me. Please upgrade quality service.
30900,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love app. I watch JoJo's Bizzare Adventure anime. But problem I amount ads. I understand need make money 10 million people Crunchyroll phones. There also lot users consoles computers. What lot people want amount ads shortened. I get 15-25 ads episode. One question, Crunchyroll come Nintendo Switch? Crunchyroll consoles it'd great Switch."
30901,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Im making review explain three stars. Pros: Fairly good pricing terms subscription. Can somewhat watch anime phone. Updated recent releases anime. Now Con: After videos in, either video cannot play audio lagging behind. Sometimes cannot even watch single episode due ""buffering"" Does older anime, slightly disappointed. That's give ""okay."""
30902,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Absolutely awful. In standard episode 4 advertisement slots. That bad add slot play 3 adds time. Add fast-forward, add slots would skipped go another. I understand need adverts. I actually mind sometimes I see show I want watch them. What I can't deal seeing adverts, show I'm trying watch!"
30903,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"The great. It large selection anime anyone without account watch, rarely lags decent internent connection ads short, brings bad points. I patient guy comes ads, long they're short, however occasionally gives unskippable 10 min ads, I find unacceptable. I got watch anime, ads. If patient guy watch frequent short ads, go ahead app! I highly recommend it!"
30904,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Love app. It's easy everyday usage. Also I like watching new genres while. But thing I ""issue"" requires credit card instead debt. Don't know going option switch either future. If option switch either pls let know."
30905,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love app. Something I would like add old animes like ""Blood +"" ""Itazura Na Kiss"" good animes can't find YouTube. Also, WAY TOO MANY ads. Please see comment try fix this. Thanks understanding reading comment. Bye!"
30906,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Love crunchyroll recently mobile (at least OnePlus 5T) load content even queue. Was working fine recently. I lot traveling fails I'm left wondering I'm paying premium membership. I love content please fix
30907,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I used pay premium mobile viewing got bad I stopped. Now watch 6 adverts I closed app, never got video. I give, never work properly bad. Maybe VRV pet project releases outside america it'll get better. For now, find anime elsewhere."
30908,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Excellent provide. The good except two things. First data usage. Five episodes Boruto used 4.55 GB. If there's way select lower resolution video save data I've yet find it. Second I've ever used slowly drain phone battery charging.
30909,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"The great wide selection anime easy navigate. The price good ads, I've recently problems keep buffering work several minutes. Not sure temperamental bug it'll long time."
30910,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Great paid service. Some translation bit shonky occasionally, forgivable. The major enhancement needs proper filtering ordering watch list. Being able sort last watched latest release, even name would make easier find looking scrolling list order added things."
30911,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,Love it... But even though I premium member long time (more 2 years) I getting adds I last weeks... Fix ASAP premium member adds playing. And watch 4-5 adds per video outrageous I pay. But previous services wonderful untill 3 weeks ago
30912,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Upgrading rating two stars four stars. The bug fixes seem resolved quite issues I facing app. A great platform watching anime, I've got premium account definitely think worth money! Keep good work team!"
30913,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I really like App. It good design easy handle. And everyone freeze buffing issues, tip: Just go settings deactivate auto setting video quality. Just decide low high(depending Internet) good go. It worked really crappy phone (Android)"
30914,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I give 2 star, buffering sort good, shows enjoyeble watch. Lately though fix buffering issue I would rate higher. Don't like watching 30 secs show buffering hits wait longer show plays. Can't believe I pay premium get kinda problem. Give days fixed UNISTALLING. Cancelling sub"
30915,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love app, premium SO worth it. However, I say, might device model, Anime freezes lot, like every 3 minutes? I know iPad, still freezes different Internet connections. Watching ipad great, would convenient quality phone. Waiting freezes still worth though!"
30916,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"The offers great amount anime series, however million ads per episode much buy premium membership 5 euro, I mind buying membership allow credit cards, I credit card debit card. It gets 1 star many ads possibility buy membership well many European users. Please change overall rating go"
30917,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Have years I love anime man streaming ability terrible. If I mobile device, even hooked good wifi signal streaming I cannot watch constantly buffering. Tried several different devices several different wifi. This issue. To point I cannot watch unless I'm console."
30918,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I note 8 meant immersive videoplay video fixed window...I guess look good 5 inch less mobile phones, plus piece anime available!! This close pressing back button , close multi window !! So used around like 5 minutes , ruined mood !! UNINSTALLING!!"
30919,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"This truly amazing. If kind person wants watch anime without paying, deal ads, good thing ads can't tapped open new tab anything, also put perfect spots like commercial break. If want pay like Netflix anime! Great app! The anime I know Tokyo Ghoul."
30920,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,I would rate 5 stars seasons big series like Fairy Tail. There newest one. Black Butler also missing. Same Tokyo Ghoul first season Attack On Titan. If well I'd happy give 5
30921,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love content price membership. It's pretty affordable. However, I can't seem watch anything without freezing. I also logged account tv keeps showing adds like I premium account. If put effort fix bugs, even higher cost, it'll worth it. Looks like I'm going find another place stream anime I want watch."
30922,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"Honestly, I like database, needs lot work. I'm premium member price, least sort playback options, I can't control anything, I queue items yeah. It work. I eventually uninstalled, wanted see episode something I installed again. Changing rating 1 star instead 2. I'm writing 7th ad currently running. The episode started yet. I remember I uninstalled xD"
30923,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I know I uninstalled yet. I start video.... 3 minutes ads. Every 4 minutes.... 5 minutes ads. I buy Premium stop ads. I start video..... 30 seconds buffering. Every 3 minutes..... 2 minutes buffering (doesn't matter I'm using data wifi). Not much difference wasting time. Get act together, people!"
30924,Crunchyroll - Everything Anime,"I love anime, episodes reserved premium! You'll spend hours watching 3 seasons My Hero Academia rewarded getting watch last episode! The ads bad though. You watch 20 minute episode get 3 minutes ads. I think people witnessed tv commercials middle show something like that."

31125,Cut the Rope 2,"I hate games penalize playing them, every 3 runs get 30 second ad, typically longer runs combined. Then, character runs energy, penalized 5 minutes wait energy return pay more. Puzzle games like thes... Full Review"
31126,Cut the Rope 2,"If want enjoy game, dish 5$ front ads way agressive. The problem even time enjoy gameplay try game correctly ads. In end , another game unistall."
31127,Cut the Rope 2,Its adorable great time killer But many ads. Every time I fail level 3 times long ad pops up. Every time I finish level challenges oops look another ad plz fix
31128,Cut the Rope 2,Best advertiser ever! I think done marvellous job advertising games. Cool get play mini games get feed On Non candy however I think able watch ads chose rather complete another level see appears next. That reason I rate 5*. Keep good work. Perhaps change ads time time.

31131,Cut the Rope 2,"Unplayable adverts, I appreciate pay development game etc non stop. It's far much 30 second advert every 3 runs. Unless willing pay advert free version bother"
31132,Cut the Rope 2,This game almost unplayable many ads give $5.00!? Seriously?! I inclined play game well things shove 600 ads throat time I played upto level 5
31133,Cut the Rope 2,It's enjoyable far I fun I think first way better terms puzzles tight precise sometimes creative.
31134,Cut the Rope 2,A prime example freemium concept completely ruins gameplay experience. Constant ads incredibly aggressive forced (paid) 'upgrades' make potentially wonderful game unplayable. Avoid even huge fan first one.
31135,Cut the Rope 2,"Awesome. Last 5 years ago played cut rope, good. I get 5 Stars. So well addictive. Well Played. BOSS OF LEGEND"
31136,Cut the Rope 2,I think game would better character eat little boy green I love nice gob

31546,Czech Public Transport IDOS,The Prague always got reliable results. Even Google Maps sometimes current timetables. I reminders work well even smart watches.
31547,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Unfortunatelly free version adverts big mage unusable. They removed time purchase good app. || Free version unfortunately has all the annoying ads that are big. They can be removed by a one-time payment, then a good app."
31548,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Hello, good For God's sake, I change ""my location"" radius? When start stop location +-20m possibility change, feature TOTALLY useless want find stop really near you. I would expect changing would obvious working... Besides fail, good app."
31550,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"I daily miss couple connections, I can't figure show list I search otherwise I like"
31551,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Fast & accurate. Even better buy premium remove ads, annoying thing app."
31552,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"This really great! exact. But I'd like add extra: first bus (on time) arives nearby stop walking distance 5-7 minutes, I think written option too. Thanks!"
31553,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Annoying ads! Pubtran is better, he does not have ads. I was used to IDOS, but after months of use, Badoo Badoo ads started to appear, etc. I'm moving to competition."
31554,Czech Public Transport IDOS,A great application that will show you exactly where to get from point A point B if you use urban transport so much I recommend.
31555,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Properly designed applications should allow downloading of user-selected timetables for use in offline mode, even in a paid version."
31558,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"Once, it occurred to me that the application showed a different bus time than a web version. The web version was correct."
31559,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"fine appka, help me every day when I'm flying on the train. The current train delay is a quick search for a link including search history. Very user-friendly interface. I know I have to add, or I do not have to be so rushed."
31560,Czech Public Transport IDOS,The older version amazing. How I downgrade?
31561,Czech Public Transport IDOS,Since my past evaluation has improved a lot with applications in this form I am satisfied.
31562,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"The great, I want buy tickets gets stuck passenger screen next continue buttons. I.e. I can't buy tickets"
31564,Czech Public Transport IDOS,"This is a very good timer application, but it is a pity that you can not download offline timetables. That's why I still prefer an unnamed app that allows you to buy a one-year license to download offline timetables for a relatively small fee (about $ 10)."
31566,Czech Public Transport IDOS,I've living Czech Republic since months perfect travelling understanding everything buses trains! Thanks!

32174,DINO HUNTER: DEADLY SHORES,"This game great, picked I found old tablet I've blast. Only problem levels load properly. Namely, Troodon levels requiring bow (freezes immediately starting), Mandible's trophy hunt. The latter caused lot problems, dinosaur's model load properly, shots fired target areas recognized, dinosaur literally goes map itself, player spawned incorrectly moved closer dinosaur gets close time essentially slows ""final shot"", were, nothing fire I'm stuck broken view legs groin. These made level hard beat, hitboxes things essentially broken. Other that, game great."
32176,DINO HUNTER: DEADLY SHORES,I remember game years ago amazing. You could roam around shoot many dinosaurs wanted point shoot. I uninstalled piece garbage ASAP. Please bring old game back

32194,DINO HUNTER: DEADLY SHORES,For want buy purchases game them. Can't get threw game spending money. The coin purchase choices slim unless want spend $19.99 every time need 480 coins stuck signing monthly payment plan. And end mission win move next mission fairly quickly loose stuck looking read screen telling killed seems quite bit lag time it. Graphics good game controls ok I guess good get phone screen.

34998,Divar,"The first days of the first was very good. Firstly, that at that time inside a part you were going to show similar ads, it was easy to pick the city; now, in my opinion, the hole of defects in the wall has not been seen and done,"
34999,Divar,"Really bad The more you advertise, the more you are at the stage of posting. It's really a disaster. I'm advertising something. First see what works right? !!!!! I've reinstalled several times."
35000,Divar,Why is this new update? We will update it We can not go into my advertisements It's very hard for you to fix it Like a simple one?
35001,Divar,Filtering and sending should be more professional. Why not change the city and see new cities?
35002,Divar,"This app has a good performance in terms of guild classification. The main problem that most users do not appreciate is the time to upgrade the ad. The update to the market, which is to be forced to install the market, is the next problem that many times by email, support, etc. I do not have any sort of pricing filter for items like property, and so on; everyone publishes at whatever price it desires; in guilds like real estate; it's a hit on the market; we hope it's going to be a problem."
35003,Divar,"After the update, every time the program is used it blocks and the device gets hot"
35004,Divar,I'm gonna hit you on your brain that has all these eternities you can not solve the basic problems yet / Do not understand the message section When someone sends you a message when you hammers and hangs up the program has a checkmark / I've looked at 10 times / Do not understand at least section Add a message to add / Add to Imam Hussein Create / Reed with this app / Iranian Congregation Everything is Thermal and Craft
35005,Divar,"It was pretty good already, but it's not functional at all"
35006,Divar,"Plus, you can only add a larger image"
35007,Divar,"In the selection of the city, add a search in the whole of Iran"

Can't login Google I used Gmail account manually sign up, Doordash can't manage simple task linking authentication methods. Grubhub struggle basic issues. Simple, needs filter sort options. I able sort estimated delivery. If I'm looking something quick, make hunt it."
35836,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"While I like restaurants delivery apps, awful. Whenever I place order, delivery/pickup time constantly updating - every minute gets pushed back minute. It's especially frustrating I'm trying pickup order I idea go! Also I placed order pickup future time, told would ready half hour early! Worst ever."
35837,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"I ordered sandwich longer available someone called within minutes switched out. Later, I received another call doordash exact question. I told sandwich I switched to, fine. My estimated time 27 minutes due delivered, I saw added something different order new delivery time 20 minutes out. I contacted issue offered resolution. Customer complete garbage. They located another country barely understand english."
35838,DoorDash - Food Delivery,A waste time I wish I ordered Uber anyone else. Delivery hour fourteen minutes behind food sat lights 50 minutes sitting restaurant order kept getting reassigned driver's could deliver literally every order apparently.
35839,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Love door dash since restaurants better delivery fees competition. My #1 chief complaint though wants tip dasher set checkout. This ridiculous, tip based provided yet completed I know dahsher wort 15% 30%? I would want offer tip option order delivered."
35840,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"It worked twice. After matter I try order, says ""payment cannot verified."" It since I able order before! No customer help anywhere tried getting help Facebook profile. That help anything wanted email. I'm using email works thats great guess I going back terrible grubhub!"
35841,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"This worthless. First order l select option alternative items would acceptable item available. I get call DoorDash customer saying going cancel order. The agent horrible customer service, extremely rude, could barely speak English. I'll certainly using ever again."
35842,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"First, I say drivers courteous, everything else SUCKS. I'm Las Vegas, 24-hour city. I orders placed lunch break (I work nights) took much longer time given, often places would close (or closing) alert, automatic forwarding order next business day! The give business hours restaurants, exist. Many times, drivers would go get food, wait made I've already waited 45 minutes more. The delivery add-on prices vary fast food joints block! I keep case might work another city, otherwise, I GRUBHUB!"
35843,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Ive using uber eats way expensive. I love first time free delivery way less expensive. The places I want like five guys never available always mess order. Haven't gotten food yet hoping much better.
35844,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"The best delivery ever! I've issue restaurant's fault - dasher; even tho fault, door dash gave credit towards next purchase. These folks really take pride work shows. I'd recommend anyone, especially Phoenix, wants stay heat gotta eat!"
35845,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Once awhile makes mistakes. Canceling something order difficult sometimes. Some items restaurants offer dessert Townhouse Restaurant omitted. I used ""Door Dash"" many times I appreciate service. The delivery people always friendly helpful."
35846,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Ordered food 1230. Told us food would 130. Every time time food arrive, would add 20 30 minutes. Here 3am still food. Best part customer called asked canceled. They stated anything fix it. ""No drivers area."" Why give time make happen. Total scam. Dont fall it."
35847,DoorDash - Food Delivery,First all. Don't allow order go get charged cancel it. Second customer support robotic makes sick. Hearing response 4 times row stupid. And get anywhere.
35848,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Great I never problem . You able tip drip though. I usually tip high expensive places I'm third stop driver takes long ass route I dont think deserve it. Tip please
35849,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"This worst food apps, every single time I ordered something missing drivers would take wrong places, really really bad experience. Do Uber eats way better call liar claim food delivered."
35850,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Try place order first time. It good size $90 order..inputted credit card info stated could verify payment info..did different cc... issue.. got frustrated means nothing info input correct... Kind sucks esp get info exact issue hand.. gave went old school actually called restaurant...
35851,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Multiple screwups. My first order, possibly last via app, scheduled 9:30 pm. Restaurant closes 1 am. Plenty time. However, doordisaster pass schedule restaurant. It arrived 8:15. Nobody home, scheduled time people would home. When managed get order, naturally exactly fresh, incorrect. Checking receipt restaurant, gave exactly receipt, I wanted. Whether screwup server keying order system side doordash, knows. We've decided give chance, needs go smoothly game"
35852,DoorDash - Food Delivery,This retarded accept payment options. I tried four different cards denied all. Don't waste time.
35853,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"The works fine. I can't get wait times! I placed order 1130pm I type 1pm.. still here. This first time either. I guess DoorDash enough drivers maybe delivery service? Or maybe ask tip before? *Edit* It 1:17pm Door Dash contacted let know restaurant making order know why! Let's say, I'm deleting stupid app."
35854,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"I issues using Google pay, weird I could right I used purchase door dash subscription. I switch option actual card get work."
35855,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Made order driver tells restaurant closed 7 min estimated delivery gets cancelled. And youre left hungry? Does door dash know whether restaurants open closed? And asks tip even experienced driver?? So tipped canceled order...do get refund too? Plus 1st time using happens... Refunds take 5 7 days well. Lol. Skip.
35856,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Not bad, weird tip driver delivery. What go beyond? What they're bad? I find way give feedback (other pre defined options like order missing, late, unprofessional, etc). Good good, driver showed estimate said still couple minutes away I got good promptly ordered."
35857,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Used good payment options refuse take credit card I I never services again. Your error detecting software messed I even took picture card said error.
35858,DoorDash - Food Delivery,The great never consistent order updates. One second shows order restaurant next second order door. This inconvenience since I like meet delivery person disturb roomates. The map function seems useless.
35859,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"The quick convenient. Though resteraunts I would like available, still good selection. If looking late night delivery, offered. One big thing complaint tipping. Ive deliverers take personal detours even kick back relax delivering food, making cold soggy. I really like tipping BEFORE delivery thats kind get."
35860,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"first time user I thought great super easy functional. I wish menu section like adding sides (I ordered mexican) salsa, sour cream etc problem I like add tips too!"
35861,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"It's easy use, days people want get that's okay. Door dash save day lol corny"
35862,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Order food 20 minutes later I get call telling ""merchant"" working cancel order. They, however, charge card said would refund hung me. Customer non existent. I stick Uber Eats."
35863,DoorDash - Food Delivery,The time originally says delivery choosing restaurant different time check out. Not happy
35864,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"At beginning fine, longer I it, worse gotten. Orders coming cold I've wait long order! Definitely deleting today."
35865,DoorDash - Food Delivery,I ordered mcdonalds driver did not fully place order. Do app. They try take big order steal your money.
35866,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Ordered dinner check out, quoted 30 minutes. An hour later still way, 75 minutes order suddenly cancelled I'm left hungry. No recourse, unimpressed"
35867,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"It takes way long menu categories load, I first enter page, also time I view items category come back out. If takes long load data, might worth displaying items page instead needing go category. I also tried submitting feedback automatically received automated 'this email use' response."
35868,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Was forced pay 10 dollar subscription place order never went through. Waste time money.
35869,DoorDash - Food Delivery,"Order food, shows door. Wait times bit high times estimate pretty accurate know expect. I LOVE app."
35870,DoorDash - Food Delivery,At first worked pretty well I would rated 4 stars. Consistently time went deliveries got slower began problems. Now longer reliable.
35871,DoorDash - Food Delivery,Don't order app. Ordered food date arrived 3 HOURS early. Jesus Christ. Wasted bunch money.

However, me, I dont like see recent used recent search results, option disable 1 button clear search could definitely make better me. Anyhow, 10 10 would definitely recommend others.

41282,Evie Launcher,"I suggestion regarding folder animation. The animation opening folder homescreen bit ""heavy"" tbh, zoom inside it, makes inside go middle screen, larger smartphone's screen makes harder reach inside esp using hand.

The downside unable support favorite search engines (ecosia qwant) limited choice search bar. Less importantly would amazingly useful internal (such music documents) could accessible search bar well.

42081,FERZU - Furries Social Network,"Decent meeting furs. The Good: - It's Groiko app, contains features find associated website. - Clean interface pages - Nearby page updates device location The Bad: - Pages require loading, clicking newsfeed messages back newsfeed reloads feed, making lose place - No upload preview photos prior publishing site - Photos sometimes upload rotated orientations (possibly due Metadata tags device?) - Profile photo must uploaded gallery, cropping function photo. This worsened photo viewing limit, meaning may 2 versions photo, profile picture version full version, potentially wasting someone's free full-size photo viewings - Weird non-blanket hate speech policy (only specific groups protected hate speech, everyone site, despite ""safer space everyone""), fine unless susceptible negative reprocussions online harassment (lowered self-esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc) All decent app. Hope gets improved!"

The story captivating, summoning mechanic difficult, there's generally good variety events. It's even confined play ffvi! I recommend final fantasy games anyone looking gacha depth usual"
42166,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Gameplay like old school rpg, good wont stop playing it. Really, though. They keep adding events, add heroes available such. Dont worry premium currency, easy get. You dont need buy it. But coutse ""payer"" advantage, excellent game"
42167,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"The game fun mechanics good. But walking around towns places game gets slow... For game graphic style needs optimization. Also, find way store downloaded data storage please. When get fixed I gladly give 5 stars."
42168,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Seems alright far, premium currency given generously rolls expensive give lots free rolls balances out. Digging star ocean anamnesis promotional event, I actually started playing ffexivus it. Would nice I could get SO chars I guess I can't get greedy. Pretty good gatcha game"
42169,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Great game, full story, tonnes events actively developed. Free play takes bit longer get started bit grind time quite competitive. The game playable without spend, free play micro transactions done quite well :)"
42170,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,Been playing two years love it. People leaving rubbish reviews dont enjoy luck based games. Ive played two year n spent like $10 total quite top tier units. Support pretty good too. Great game. From omnia player exvius player. Now
42172,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"After new update, stupid difficult made obtain seven star unit, I'm deleting app. I playing now. Just got good units up. Not make harder get up, drop rates, stupidly low. How expect people get units get times they're lucky? Stupid update choice. I'm quitting."
42173,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"U get utter trash summons. I step summon get 5 stars raegan, brother gets noctis cloud. I'm done game waste ur time."
42174,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,I've played since started. It impossible beat everything unless TMRs never get unless fork thousands dollars. Dont waste time one. Gatcha game max. Super low drop rates. Shameless scam.
42175,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,This newest update seems make sound crackle bit. Still dont cloud strife ;) I love game I played since launch. Highly recommended. WARNING: Playing eat time XD
42176,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"This game scam. The drop rates atrocious, bugs incredibly infested game. They rob expect pay poor copy paste job good Japanese game. The bundles way overpriced spend money make top 10 every event. This game joke. All gacha games awful worst. Avoid cost."
42177,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"This game awesome, favourite FF characters, some. Plenty crossover events keep things fresh. The problem game size. It's huge, currently pushing 2GB, big, would perfect"
42178,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,Brings favorite Final Fantasy characters together game good ol' sprite form. It's gotten better better past 2 years (finally got Cloud Squall)
42179,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Some issues bugs weekly maintenance sometimes, resolve send users compensation. Lot do, never say I'm caught up. Events limited equipment rotate biweekly keep players interested."
42180,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,Quite simply can't get enough game! With minimal spending I managed get things I could hoped devs super point compensating bugs ands maintenance free rewards. More free giveaways I ever seen! Top notch game story!
42182,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"After year play I still love game much I started. They support game players anything could ask RPG. Gacha draws bit pricy pay, get lot free personally I see gachas way support great game, content get vast. I hope see game continue many years come."
42183,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"It's ok first, gets old quick. After gets work fun. I know games like usually kind grindy game becomes lot work little reward. It's also really repetitive. There's new events every week they're really 3 4 events different characters different stories."
42184,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"The game, concept, graphics amazing gets old quickly. The biggest issue promotion microtransactions. They occasion mispromote items units. An example would 100% 5*, spent weeks promoting release unveil $50 price tag attached ability game currency system Another example step-up summons. It also ~$50 using ingame buyable currency. In games ""fine print"" find make shifting scale obtaining promoted unit. Ie less popular units get 100% chance vs popular units get multiplier(note) x5 multiplier low chance still low chance effectively spending $50. The game stays popular pay people play game currency system floating FF title."
42185,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"The game general great. It simplifies old roots game. But execution, could little less tedious. Not fan .004% drop rates character I would like buy/use. I understand monetization. But gives little incentive pay X amount miniscule chance ever getting desire. If broke categories little made less ridiculous, This game would be, opinion (if mine matters) best game could possibly mobile device. Great game. Just wish easier players enjoy characters want."
42186,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"7 star update worst thing happen game. Now instead relying ridiculously small chance possibly get unit want, 2-4x make unit relevant. The game give players enough resources own, especially pay win. The choices either spend ton money get left behind. Last patches shown developers care money gameplay users fun. I wish I could read Japanese jffbe seems appreciate user base much more."
42187,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"I love game, gameplay amazing, always growing, simple user friendly UI animated limit bursts new units. They always give aways, anytime unscheduled maintenance due issue, give compensation. Customer phenomenal, everytime I contacted replied quickly politely. Nothing 5/5 across board opinion. Every game like FFBE strive done make users top priority."
42188,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"My keeps crashing choosing tutorial not, matter I choose. Please correct phone works totally fine. Thank"
42189,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"More 4.5 star, I going give 4 star minor ui annoyances I have. Otherwise, reminds lot older FF games I loved, mixed new collection type games. A lot options party abilities. Frequent special events means pay good progression, makes go lot faster."
42190,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"This game player friendly game, every event helping us become stronger. I request,could add Cloud FFVII Advent Children outfit & add Genesis Crisis Core please XD"
42191,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"A paradoxical game ever one. On hand, good story fun play. On hand, that's works, dev team far better breaking updating it. This time around, random session drops, broken scrolling menus, misaligned area tiles. Joy."
42192,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Great, addicting game crammed full classic RPG play. Well designed characters variety elemental status attack defense options, tons equipment, seemingly endless quests. There always next goal reach, I spend WAY much time this. Character sprites well-drawn look like 16-bit versions themselves. All classic FF characters (minus 8, favorite) appear along many original ones look attack like original selves 16-bit glory. Fun addictive. Kudos."
42193,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,When really get game super fun. They give much free laps crazy. Haven't spend nothing got great 6 star units
42194,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,STOP DOING MAINTENANCE AT THE END OF THE DAY. ONLY START MAINTENANCE WHEN THE DAY STARTS. CHANGE WHEN THE GAME'S DATE ROLLS OVER IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE WHEN YOU DO MAINTENANCE.
42195,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Update: I wrote game 'magnificent' I wrong, keep messing game none stop, I first started game summon rates fair, they're bad, even set ups bad... They 1 year behind original Japanese version game, translate copy paste, even bother fix patches release..."
42196,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,It's great far. But really hard obtain weapons materials upgrade. Characters story bit hard access since access via menu scroll lot.
42197,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"This fun game, constant banner units make feel like wasting resources. Used 4 months savings single 5* banner units. Used 30% ticket, got off-banner. Gonna take break. You play long start hate"
42198,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"The main story would good enough keep entertained, top add new events pretty much every week... impossible stop playing!"
42199,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,Whales now. If $50 regularly waste slim chance getting unit want game you. Since thats price ff15 game actual production value ill spend money elsewhere thanks.
42200,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,I can't continue fulan pass stage? Always reject app. Please fix I continue playing FFBE. Thanks attention.
42201,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"After update, put advertisement.. They really need it?? Wohh really annoying adv put latest update.. Your guys may lost player.. Better put youtube generate side income, like mobile legend.."
42202,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"nice FF game, nice game. IF want play FFBE, DONT PLAY THIS FFBE. corp handle game GUMI. greddy one. Play JP version Instead. odds summoning 5 star base better there, lot good event too."
42203,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Beautiful interface, RPG core. Beautiful graphics stay true original, interesting enough storyline. However, someone played single FF game before, confusing. The interface cluttered confusing, hard get help. Even hints presented confusing manner! I'm still rookie quests I much idea complete them. So I'm following main storyline. It seems interesting, maybe even good enough buy original games."
42204,FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS,"Another ""wait energy recharge pay money keep playing"" game. Probably good financial bottom line Square Enid et al, makes playing damned tedious. I enjoyed FF years ago Nintendo. So three stars retro look only."

It lacks a lot of optimization, it is terrible, but it is very bad, so they charge you $ 199 per month for having it? Better pay Netflix, it's multy platform, cheaper the content is better."

42855,Facebook,"Since recent updates bloody stupid thing tells someone commented status mine I notification refuses show comments. Also, I watch video full screen FB I can't back come completely (and therefore lose video I watching refreshes itself)."
42856,Facebook,"People seem ignorant permissions mean. It doesnt mean take video pictures without knowledge. It means want take picture video, allowed let open camera Facebook."
42857,Facebook,"After recent updates I unable see posts notifications. I see notification I tap nothing appears ""from notifications"" section group/page. Also frustrating able see recent posts groups. Whoever's making decisions aesthetics basic functions needs replaced someone actually competent. Cheers"

42863,Facebook,It's best social network doubt. But stopped development rising country. Cause! Some ultra crazy young generation always busy using this. So wasting much time here.
42864,Facebook,"Recent updates made using connect friends pages I interest difficult - news feed shows several day old posts, neglects even include pages I follow instead floods feed adverts promoting pages/posts. It's point I even bother - I see friends moving social media platforms Facebook."
42865,Facebook,"What Facebook sorting news feed chronologically?? Most time, pressing ""most recent"" button leads sad cloud says ""can't connect"". When work, news top hours old refreshing rings different hours-old post top feed."
42866,Facebook,"Now deleted ""always open external browser"" function. Now always open manually open links. It's time sell shares. No improvement point, getting ridiculous update."
42868,Facebook,Can't upload photos within forces closed every time even full restart cache clear. Slow times unresponsive. And feel tip stories default option everyone open app?!

42920,Facebook,Since update 2 days ago I can't read single artical. Everytime I 30 seconds goes grey saying page can't load. Even though already loaded fine. It's beyond annoying
42921,Facebook,"Facebook fails regards ensuring profiles legitimate. Their ""community standards"" vague pitiful set rules compared determining validity people reported. Were business I would continue using social media. Shame Facebook allowing people create fake profiles post lies negative things hurt peoples reputations."
42922,Facebook,"Well 3 days ago I searched marketplace second hand tv stand daughter's bedroom. Facebook updated today news feed full marketplace posts bloody tv stand anywhere 20 minutes 9 bloody days ago!!! Literally chronological order friends posts would make sort since setting called ""recent"" Just tv stand poxy tv stand! Do devs really think helpfull???? Marketplace posts news feed standard unless choose turn on. Bloody morons charge app!"
42924,Facebook,"The ""news"" feed joke. Facebook insists shoving ""thinks"" I want see. So I always used 'most recent' feed because, shocker, I want see feed chronologically. But getting fowled up! How something posted week ago considered 'more recent'??? And next item 5 minutes, followed 5 hours, followed 20 minutes, on. Ridiculous. I would say getting unusable, version bad, FACEBOOK IS BECOMING UNUSABLE. Plain simple. Another reason I'm surprised stock tanking."
42925,Facebook,Thus seems automatically update even turned auto update option. I limited amount internet data want used cause Facebook wants update daily. Please fix cause I'm getting ready delete app. It's frustrating
42926,Facebook,This offers terrible privacy. I can't like something without showing friends feed. This keeps showing scam suggested adds thing I reported multiple times. If Facebook competition good I would go instead.

42932,Facebook,"Unable view original post photos. More newer app, complicated users. New versions becoming monster ads permissions. FB seems sample gestures really, becomes fragile real life. Peace."
42933,Facebook,"I can't anything app.. got Galaxy S9 plus can't access Facebook all..keeps saying connection lost EVERYTIME I log in, I know I service. Even fter asking identity authentication questions..which I answered correctly. It sits frozen blue screen.... I pretty bummed..I looking forward using FB new phone."
42934,Facebook,"Newsfeed shows posts two weeks ago. Have PC see recent posts. Also, I keep getting notifications going phone every time someone comments someone else's post. I go Android settings block notifications get stop. Third, removed ability turn sounds. The developer noob know fix it. Use Twitter instead. Edit: still fixed update."
42935,Facebook,"Load up, start reading feed exits out. Open back suddenly I can't locate posts I reading. Oops, kicked back again. It's normal crash, restarts. Edit 5/6/2018: It's restarting middle commenting. It's crashing, shutting restarting. It's really pissing off. I'm ready go version instead deleting 500+mb waste space. Update 8/1/2018: The nRwest version Err_Name_Not_Resolved error kicks reading page. I know many times I reload site finish reading article."
42936,Facebook,"While there's definitely plenty good content here, slowly starting turn something possibly edgy Tumblr... Even report posts flat offensive take seriously."
42937,Facebook,"When post something sale tell can't posted? Also items tagging people? After comment, show anything unless I I still can't see I'm typing comment, went I can't see post someone tagged unless I go page? Hey remove info marketplace post posted? Now I can't tell that's new garage sale week old. Too bad show reason got bad rating marketplace item for. I liked better clicked three lines go group instead clicking groups finding group. I liked before, would get notification would tell friend area. Can please put time back comments? Instead says 1 hour ago something. Hey would cool, could make spot marketplace auction ship. I like ratings marketplace."
42938,Facebook,"I like recent update makes go back top news feed every time I'm done looking picture article. I find incredibly frustrating. Other that, fine. I'm thrilled losing place every time I want see read something. Edit- recent update causing crash constantly."
42939,Facebook,Since newest update none pictures Profile Pics load stays blank. And everytime I try scroll feed crashes. What heck happened fine days ago latest update
42940,Facebook,"Ok I'm kinda fed Facebook right now.... I clue I've able update I also know (this also apply tablets, phones wife's."
42941,Facebook,"Not sure video lagging FB AND IG. Videos work platforms phone. Also typing message comments, wierd can't describe it. Almost hesitate typing."
42942,Facebook,"After recent update, every hours so, stops working. Anytime I touch select, registers touch complete function. Have tried uninstall/reinstall still glitching. Truly annoyed. Maybe stop releasing updates every three days......"
42943,Facebook,"The consistently slow clearing cache, deleting data, reinstalling, even restarting device, constantly loses place posts status updates every update. These issues addressed adding Snapchat clone literally nobody uses already Snapchat that. Updated August 2018: Reinstalled try again, removed option open links externally. I wish I could ask money back, worst GUI ever."
42944,Facebook,The current update sucks forces fb shut scrolling newsfeed. I faced issue Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro device equipped SD 636.
42945,Facebook,"Genuinely poor video quality newsfeed. I'm talking uploads, I'm talking people's/pages. I've tried absolutely everything, updating phone app, Clearing cache, deleting reinstalling itself. Nothing! I know fact connection, wifi data, due fact I view videos perfectly fine HD. It's like past couple months. Over it."
42946,Facebook,"Thia new update I today really ruined works. It doesnt need fixed :( update makes worse. Now I type comments, text box flashes. I can't get rid notifications either. And now, I figure new windows everything. Haha."
42947,Facebook,"It's always gotta something I guess. WHY DID YOU GET RID OF THE THIRD PARTY POSTING I job post 3 5 times day. Thats I make money, personal facebook normally much better group many people see it. And I time every hours make posts. With buffer I had, I could make night schedule pop whenever I wanted I can't. What heck."
42948,Facebook,"Cannot view pages within Facebook more, keeps giving connectivity/wifi error messages accessing outside content.. funny everything still loads can't read quick enough gives error message."
42949,Facebook,"Every update getting worst. There date time products Market. It important date included. Before update like hours posted something like ""posted week ago"" please include date tje item posted Market."
42950,Facebook,"The recent update sucks. My weird stuff day - comments load, I try type comment screen jumps around... Ridiculous."
42951,Facebook,"This seems get updated every day, every update gets worse. Can't watch videos landscape, go link comes message saying closed I wifi connection. How I see link I connection?"
42952,Facebook,Most recent posts NOT ones hours days behind current time. This getting annoying. It's stupid scrolling thru old posts someone recently commented liked it. Where's recent post option?
42953,Facebook,Decided simplify review issue. You disconnecting friends. A post three minutes ago might turn 'most recent' feed top 'anybody's guess' ordered feed. Or worse might 30 posts feed beneath load I've already read still nowhere found 'most recent'. All content visible 'most recent' specific order. Let decide I see I interact
42954,Facebook,"I removed notifications I still getting stupid number showing next app?! It's frustrating open Facebook see someone uploaded new photo I new friend suggestion. If I wanted see I would notifications on. Please fix this, I hate seeing stupid number time especially stupid reasons!"
42955,Facebook,terrible. The controls lag disappointing. I also ios much smoother faster. simple things like watching video basic frustrating. Serious fb can't difficult make good ios version. Sort out.
42956,Facebook,From last update videos sound remains playing scrolling news feed overlap videos sound previous video sound stop till close fully Facebook app.. annoying..
42958,Facebook,"Way intrusive apart slow getting worse since constant update reliability speed. Very annoying update news feed reading that's ignorant. Getting worse every update continuing get worse. Will leave playing video stopped still ignorant problem updating news feeds read something. It's pathetic great long read fast watch video. Have un installed /reinstalled, problems Xperia tablet z. Comments appearing disappearing. 2/8/18 still occurring."
42959,Facebook,"Very poor maintenance performance. It can't initiate English UK, past week, shows posts several days ago, order, failing update refresh."
42960,Facebook,This new community standar stupid. They banned posting medical history cancer. Yet thousand nudes photos banned against community standar
42961,Facebook,Would great change constantly. The videos inconsistent. One video take video tab another go full screen preferred.
42962,Facebook,"They kept removing review. This trash. Hate damn people may know notification tab, matter many time I remove people, keep popping new. Photo comment still folder view. Now annoying red circle messenger icon go away even I've read msg"
42963,Facebook,"Haven't trouble three weeks ago. Feed update, I uninstalled reinstalled worked normally couple days I can't even log in, says check internet connection I know fact I stellar internet home. Sucks I admin group able contribute lately. Browser version works problem account anything."
42964,Facebook,"Update 8/3/2018 load feed notification I try open, crashes. I tried clearing cache everything else, seems latest update buggered it."
42965,Facebook,I delete completely! These last 2-3 recent updates stuck! Stop trying take much control newsfeed...especially I'm actively looking it! I reading article left page I took back top newsfeed. Wasn't first time happened either. And stop trying tell I'm allowed see anything else I've scrolled ways. Its ridiculous.
42966,Facebook,Great lot useless forced features!! Like suggested pages groupes (give people choice disable that!!!) updates frequent annoying.
42967,Facebook,"Hi Facebook, far awesome. Just hope Facebook put schedule post Facebook wall Facebook page only. Because block others make schedule post wall time like. With schedule post choose time posting. Hope Facebook thing it. THANK YOU"
42968,Facebook,New update causing Facebook crash load external articles app. Gives error message option close reload. Reloading brings back error page. Disappointed.
42969,Facebook,"It's getting worse every updates. Today got updated either can't opened, crashes immediately open else pictures loaded out. Updates supposed getting better reverse FB team coz everything getting worse."
42970,Facebook,CENSORING CONSERVATOR PAGES.. DELETING PAGES... WITH LAME EXCUSES... (while leftist pages worst things affected.. worst right wing pages lying... unlike leftist pages... ) SOLD TO THE COMMUNISTS.. RIDICULOUS..
42971,Facebook,Some error keeps popping everytime I link saying can't connect error name resolved? My wifi fine page loads perfectly I scroll refreshes error pops different links error I dunno happens I'm facebook
42972,Facebook,"Facebook auto updated six times within month, Still problems I fixed. This supposed top five Apps used around world absolutely useless!"
42973,Facebook,"Update. Contant crashing OnePlus 6. Not good. Oh STILL I describe below. What Russians all...why DO I app?! Suddenly, I'm reading article recent feed, Facebook flips away ""important"" feed-- know, feed Facebook selects what's important you. Ugh... weeks now. Annoying."
42974,Facebook,"Stop ruining newsfeed replacing ""Posts From Across Facebook"". I want po see posts friends, pages I like grous I joined people I dont know, pages I didnt like groups I didnt join!!!!!!!"
42975,Facebook,This sucks. It's buggy tries mislead users. I also understand Facebook circumventing Google Play Store updates offering update mechanism. Sounds like running scripts!
42976,Facebook,"Almost glitches. First far glitch is, every time I upload photo facebook, I launch massive search operation list somehow Facebook believe giving options see photographs gallary folder mode. I mean want post picture I save months back relevant posts? Can anything it?"
42977,Facebook,"I stunned bad company (financial) size Facebook. Comments posts load clicked on. Posts disappear one's thread. Posts disappear one's text bar entering (apart arbitrary length string), annoying bugs... Really, show-stopping bugs make hard comprehend even possible without collusion Google's Android platform. Nah, I really share Facebook's blame Google. Google repeatedly thrown adverts face commonly exposed fraudulent. It's Facebook terrible company offers conceptually cool product practically terrible implementation."

43458,Fallout Shelter,I love game think fun. I enjoy able see different characters trying make happy make vault best be. The issue I buy Mr Gutsys I could stop playing game can't auto collect without means can't play day two vault dies. But amazing game really good idea moble.
43459,Fallout Shelter,"It's pretty perfect game. It follows theme fallout puts overseer. As overseer take care valt. I love whole premise I wish could easier way receive lunch box things increase chance get vault dwellers come. Other runs perfectly, graphics good, amazing. I started game I'm almost receiving overseer part. But game perfect people like love fallout."
43460,Fallout Shelter,"The game okay. If want play like actual video game, need spend real money. Otherwise waiting forever everything. The systems good, mechanics fine, best parts game locked away behind monetary walls. Quests example easily best part game, yet, need send survivors vault away 16 hour missions barely grant rewards worth trouble. You quests, game mighty boring without them."
43462,Fallout Shelter,"This amazing game. Don't problems, exept. When I make new room say ""Power"" room. I send people two go there. So I'm like ""OK, I make another room beside it."" THAT DID JACK. IT STILL WON'T LET MORE THE TWO PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM. Now bug never happened I'm wondering reason fix get work again."
43463,Fallout Shelter,One favorite ever. With addition quests feels like there's always something do. The packs purchase actually feel like getting something fresh change mobile game. My literal issue game sometimes I'm trying look around vault I'll accidently move someone notice sometimes. 10 10 otherwise. Well done Bethesda.
43464,Fallout Shelter,"I want like game more. I think premise awesome I love fallout games. But get feeling need pay extras actually get anywhere... I prefer actually play, cheat addons purchased real money. So, me, going well. No matter I I can't seem get stats acceptable level. (I really hope ES Blades)"
43465,Fallout Shelter,"A great game played anywhere, anytime. The thing need internet connection microtransactions. I think time require pay something vault goes way downhill, so, I recommend purchasing starter pack. It includes enough supplies caps get back track. Overall, I think Bethesda awesome job this, I would highly recommend it."
43466,Fallout Shelter,"Love game, crashes time. If way lower graphics quality something keep game running large vault I would rate 5 stars. Also I like new icon, Vault Boy supposed smiling yelling. UPDATE The game longer crashing time new icon great! Keep good work!"
43467,Fallout Shelter,"Its amazing game, neef yo make go away screen. You buy Mr Gutzy leave days. nake dont loose Food, Water Power. go holiday wifi hard work dies sad please change otherwize amazing game loved graphics gameplay great game anyway"
43468,Fallout Shelter,"Great game. It takes time develop vault self-sufficient status. It's grind start get hang it, starts become easy. Remember pay attention SPECIAL status. Overlap great game. The monetary wall big deal. Clash Clans monetary wall crazy big game really isn't. Overall 4/5 stars."
43469,Fallout Shelter,"Very entertaining good while. Survival mode must anyone maxed save normal difficulty. Endgame handled well imo, reach 1million caps, base becomes impossible restructure later line due population etc, quests take long play give little reward. Once max settlers theres recurring endgame goal."
43470,Fallout Shelter,This game amazing! I got hooked first second I played it. Fantastic gameplay easy learn. One component I find fustrating trying drag characters around vault trying make aim enemies. There (pick character) button allows easily pick character move him/her around ease. Everytime I try move character I end moving game camera.
43471,Fallout Shelter,"Overall, GREAT timekiller! I played much, started crash phone... But Switch, I play again! However, it'd cool way visit vaults others. Like Bottle & Cappy visit Quests, per se. Like, could set could visit rate Vaults, even trade outfits, caps, weapons, junk, etc. Either way, really good game!"
43472,Fallout Shelter,I want give game 4 stars I cant... YOUR UPDATE (or ever) DELETED ALL MY WORK!!!!!!! HAD EVERYTHING PERFECT AND TOOK A LOT OF TIME AND IT'S ALL GONE. Edit:: I redo load see came back. It 1 2 big mission(s) I missing. All rewards it. I love game. It's much fun great game relax with...
43474,Fallout Shelter,"This game awesome! 2 honest stars though, wipes battery clean within 2 hours: *after closing app* (not force close recommended). Sorry team, inefficient either Bitcoin mining make lack ads, sh!tpile battery devouring archaea."
43475,Fallout Shelter,I dumped $ game previous vault. I toggled cloud saves believed game protected. I bought new phone fired FO find game loading cloud save. Beware. Update 6-14-18: Excited announcements E3 I decided check vaults restored. They aren't. I went Bethesda check help articles cannot get game recognize old vaults purchases.
43476,Fallout Shelter,"Much improved I first started play. More stable, things do, things get. Love pets, love still get lunchboxes free decent rate too. You always re-arrange vault. You always start too. So many options things ways play layouts suit you. Great game!"
43477,Fallout Shelter,A great fun game. You need spend money good it. You need internet play great time killer. I really reccomend many people. I wish would add like friend system like friend could trade vaults. Probably favorite game phone. Good job Bethesda.
43478,Fallout Shelter,Great fun little game. Very time consuming takes real world time progress resources. I'm fan microtransactions all. I'd rather pay inclusive experience. In game necessary provides huge shortcuts advances time faster. All fun game play go laying bed. I would recommend give try
43479,Fallout Shelter,Never addicted game like long time. You full control vault get things done dwellers (literally figuratively). Attacks happen random need prepared. You grind long time achieve great results. Most quests pretty much enemies. Check online help best tricks tips excel game. Best thing completely playable offline graphics pretty good. Definitely recommended.
43480,Fallout Shelter,I love Bethesda titles. This exception. I love also. The quest make much interesting. The thing I wish added weapons D.P.S. rating like fallouts. My assault rifles chopping stuff way quicker shotguns do.
43482,Fallout Shelter,"Love it! I'm really big fan fallout series, (I like blowing peoples heads guns) I'm really enjoying fallout shelter. It's better mobile games I've tried far, really good humour, (love elder scrolls crosover jokes) quests great, bombarded adds in-game buying time. (which I hate, free game I get make things available buy, wish games like bethesda it.) anyways would definitely recommend!"
43483,Fallout Shelter,"An awesome easy get game. An easy five stars. It's relatively generous, nuka-cola easy get quests useful binge play. However, I feel value nuka-cola could raised little. Skipping two hours great anything two hours eats whole lot substance, getting dwellers relatively difficult new comers. The gameplay lenient however, easy enjoy successful at."
43484,Fallout Shelter,"I think game really cool, first totally easy that's good. But always get's harder, raiders come, need provide incidents. But that's cool, I like challenges. The thing annoyes fact never really know, dwellers wastelands need stuff like that. But all: great game, really addicting. Oh, please change fact rename dwellers!"
43485,Fallout Shelter,Game fun buggy. Now I can't get main menu. This game broken thats expect bethseda studio's. Looking forward buggy fallout 4. Update still buggy. If enjoy playing game try playing PC instead phone. The quest easier give Rewards far less buggy
43487,Fallout Shelter,"Free pay win. Fun solid game give hours fun. Though, moving Vault dwellers phone screen always work whatever reason. I'd love update allows Vault experiments like turning Ghouls, Mutants, weird plant monsters New Vegas."
43489,Fallout Shelter,"I LOVE THAT GAME!!!Fantastic animations, great plot, everything absolutely accessible. The game super interesting. Sometimes wait worth it. After time unlock great things, strategy comes success understood important things known do. If know would get stronger gradually achieved."
43490,Fallout Shelter,"Its Bethesda game, broken. I love concepts idea Bethesda brings table, can't build game save life. The vault max capacity 200, built half vault, there's real point playing. Less consider unlockable rooms stop 100 dwellers. So game building vaults gives little incentive so. The quests fine, that's main point game, though seems I play. This supposed infinite game, relatively low ceiling. The game get truely fun first 50 dwellers stops fun 100."
43491,Fallout Shelter,"This game amazing. I'm huge Fallout fan game something else. The annoyong flaw game YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT 24/7! So, like SIMS short terms. If could setting like sleep mode people get certain time people work would AMAZING! Overall 4.8/5 stars. Plus kinda lagy play awhile."
43493,Fallout Shelter,"Great, great, great game! I love much! My boyfriend I play together. It could actually conceivably sold vault sim console taken path instead. Crazy good free game! I really love it. It's fun addictive. You able put device down!"
43495,Fallout Shelter,"Fun, fun addictive game. Its done great job including aspects fallout especially fallout 4 probaly 76 game ""like simcity"" todd howard said. The controls annoying times. As screen accident zoom somewhere. Also bonus xbox port done good job to. I would recommend!"
43496,Fallout Shelter,"This game amazing, starting get Fallout even know Fallout give like 35% less. This game additive like never ends, gather much items become Ault overseer master!!! Great job Bethesda"

45758,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"How play game better explained. I able leave guild without loosing items I found given game. For example players guild wont help whn im requesting help I ddnt understand hero got captured I know rescue him. I feel game understandable Should hv access leave guild, join another guild I like without loosing chest treasures. Other tht I like game."
45759,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"I love playing game phone although I longer afford packs yu need progress game crashing.... try play chromebook i'm connected wifi I get ""not connected internet"" message let play, I uninstalled reinstalled game, updated it, rebooted computer, downloaded connectivity diagnostics tool make sure internet connected problems is, I would like able play chromebook phone charging, please fix. Also, lower ur damn prices ur packs us poor people afford them, I gaurentee yu make money. peace."
45760,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,I love game.. So Addicting play man I brother play smash ppl game... So many nice ppl lots feiends met ... Met friend person... Great 'll thing gotta pay money got money dont play simple rate game bad cause dont like type game .. Suck butter cup play game...
45761,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,In order advance really able enjoy game HAVE spend serious money it. There lower tier price point game purchases available. I would inclined spend bucks every now-and-then instead dropping $99 dollars once. This game heavily weighted whales. Hou literally buy way ranks instead earning it.
45762,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Note Developers: great big fancy advertisement Oracle Temple, I idea does! Also I would really like silver artificers badge I cannot find sale it. I think maybe could make lot sales made able purchased time... something guys consider. The main drawback I like game much sucks battery, heats g5 phone:-)"
45764,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"The game cool, buy gold pack 5$. You'll never see another one. All deals( I term loosely) 99$. Makes kind hard get ahead reach lvl 15"
45765,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"The game fun, that's muted fact event progression leveling quickly made near impossible without spending major cash every month. Advise against. Anytime submit suggestion try improve game, get basic, copy pasted response, customer team actually appreciate care. At point, make super expensive paid drop facade free play."
45766,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"#Gameforbullies. You get level 28 minimal investment fun it. After that, either bully someone else get bullied. No between. About point get hit level 35s spent lot money. Hit 80x row dude hit 120x row. Stupid. No restrictions high levels killing low levels number times hit. I recommend staying away one."
45768,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"This becoming unstable day. I refuse spend another Cent graphics stabilized, game stops glitching. I dont care billion print pack, im strike til fix bugged game"
45769,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,Do ever game. It absolutely impossible progress without spend thousands dollars someone spends wipe troops matter 5 minutes. The developers nickel dime every bit game point can't even collect resources without spending money learn first. This worst money scam games I ever seen.
45770,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"WARNING! THIS IS NOT A FREEMIUM GAME!!! Sell kids, wife, home anything else can! The game developers money hungry put massive price EVERYTHING game help progress. Simple things like gear set presets require pay $100 unlock. And arnt paying USD, packs even more. They quickly price packs exchange rate changes take sweet time drop back rate lower. Will take weeks change. 99% game items require spend big bucks obtain. Good luck!"
45772,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,The game glitchy anytime event happening. Also many inconsistencies able attack still shielded. In certain instances allowed instances not. The packs never advertised Developers. The pack states give enough supplies points reach certain level purchase find give advertised.
45774,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,They fix maps issue. Give you battles you can't participate unless u drop couple thousand dollars pay everything. It fat money trap understand square let happen name final fantasy. They fix anything wrong
45775,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,Packs allow properly level WAY TO EXPENSIVE items receive! Game constantly crashes. Game switches prizes therefore purchase may work prize. Developers even offer solution inconvenience. As long get money care.
45777,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,Crashes way much. I'd give better rating playable. Every time I open displays internet connection message. game open background.my wifi good I switched mobile data thing. So whenever I want play I uninstall reinstall I exit game try login I issue again.
45778,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Too expensive!!! Unless plan spend fortune packs heroes nearly impossible really advance much. There way get heroes buildings unlocked without spending stack cash. Otherwise lot fun. The monsters scary cool, players best batch nerds universe. Please let us get things old-fashioned way, working game earn it!"
45779,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"The game ok. The graphics nice. This pay play game. Do play u intend spending minimum $20 weekly. The game unbalanced. U farmed many times daily players 20 million plus. Unless, u top 3 guilds, u might well get used getting attacked alot."
45780,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,Not bad game works. needs billions billions gold coins platinium RSS blue prints exalted tomes etc play game without spend money . If money prepared spend thousands upon thousands pounds. There's lots glitches prepared fixing take forever ever. Very poor service.as listen fob off.
45782,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,No point playing game unless prepared spend thousands strong enough cope players spent 10k. Absolute pure greed developers part. Disgusting prices
45783,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"You're honestly better playing game. It starts relatively easy need buy packs helpful guild. As time goes it'll get point need buy packs advance play, constantly zeroed bigger players. As soon get everyone at, they'll release something else makes progress null void. But all, game absolutely notorious ticket system developers absolutely everything scoot around issue they'll issue entirely. I wish someone would launch class action lawsuit sue them."
45784,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Horrible customer textbook ""nothing you"" replies issue experience. Money hungry developers care took money ran it. BEST ADVICE....DO NOT DOWNLOAD"
45785,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Developers greedy, I waste time. Unless money burn waste could ok, money player stand chance. The rewards developers give time ridiculous, like freemium games. The attack graphics lame show nothing exciting, I would recommend game all."
45787,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"It's addictive. The problem is, game dangerously extremely unbalanced favor big spenders. So win unless spend thousands dollars in-game purchases, can't even survive - war game, unless spend much, constantly getting attacked zeroed. So kind money spare, bother."
45788,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"This fish bait scam. Free game first buy packs new building advance city. If dont spend money, burn higher powers."
45789,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"They 0 customer worried getting money fixing problems. Its always fault even proof. They love hackers, always get free ride. Better luck getting help rock middle interstate rush hour! Love game ones run it."
45790,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"I would like upgrades buildings expensive using stone, food, energy, etc. I get pay unlock monster farm forge (the name something like that). To get seige level 2 please make less cheaper upgrade. When battle ohther realms free instead paying makes sense. To get heroes, would like sort quests hero (so pay hero), make heroes please think many heroes game. One last thing please make upgrades university little cheaper please. If least changes happy, thanks"
45791,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"I personally love Final Fantasy, I love Final Fantasy 15 also. However, game something I would pay money for. Kinda imagine Game War Final Fantasy 15 baby, that's game. I like characters, Noctis really Noctis. Noctis suddenly turned generic anime boy personality good looks. The music nice, I wish could change two songs. Also, chat really fun. If could allow us pictures add messages, would make fun. There's also fact spend money, actually advance. It's grabbing money, fall money grabbing tricks. However, I would recommend people patient like Game War Final Fantasy 15 elements sprinked top."
45792,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Game money pit. You cannot progress without spending thousands dollars. Developers greedy, support awful. Don't bother unless really deep pockets. Also, overall strategy tactics way simplistic maintain interest long. Game becomes boring."
45793,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"It's great way around board consider letting us gold platinum buy event teleports, hero building unlocks, scrolls tomes. A person spend hard earned money ($100 pack) get things need."
45795,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"Dev's need fix connection client server. chunks realm map disappear restarting temporarily fixs it. Custom chat tab save player created rooms,game freezes loading 84%."
45796,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,"I absolutely love game become expensive! If buy $1,000s packs get destroyed. I'm point I can't catch play fairly. The developers money hungry. It'll die soon greed. Many know quitting i'm verge"
45797,Final Fantasy XV: A New Empire,Customer horrible. To many bugs never fixed. You spend way much money advance. Your friends make great keeps playing game. To costly $99.00 package need advance game.

46325,Fishdom,"I uninstall update required much memory. I loose things tablet get back. The flowers pretty, necessary, I mainly play challenging puzzles enjoy tanks fish, happy without updates. Rather clunky open game now."
46326,Fishdom,Just play every day! But gets quite monotonous can't move levels play rewards only. During rounds even earn coins. Doesn't seem fair loyal supporter game.
46327,Fishdom,I enjoy game immensely... I adore fish able name them. What I dont enjoy anytime I upgrade I lose stars already completed. Makes want upgrade. I also wonder way could store free hours playtime cannot claim right away? Bombs blow nearly entire board game type bomb barely blows anything another board...annoying.
46328,Fishdom,"Too fun! Would love gameplay even if, reach end plays, screen blocked could see many plays might need complete it. Once game covered I can't tell I diamonds try go on."
46329,Fishdom,I LOVE WHEN THE FISH TALK & CARRY ON A CONVERSATION & COMMENT ON THE DEFEATS AS WELL AS. THE VICTORIES! EACH LEVEL GETS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT BUT THE REWARDS ARE FUN! SHOPPING FOR THE AQUARIUMS & THAT MAKES IT ADDICTIVE TO KEEP GOING FOR THAT SPECIAL ITEM TO PURCHASE!
46330,Fishdom,"It 1:36 pm, I got notification debit card I made purchase game 8pm tonight. I 8 yet. This second time happened. I screenshot prove it. Now I remove card Google Play account. If developers this, REALLY need look happening. Fishdom great game stealing money I draw line."
46331,Fishdom,"I like game I play. But captains games impossible complete. Too many hard, super hard, levels bunched together now. Ability create full aquariums greatly reduced extreme cost items get higher levels. Subsequently I becoming dissatisfied. Love fish though. Very peaceful."
46333,Fishdom,"Love game. Very addictive I enjoy able decorate different themed aquariums. My suggestions offer different sea creatures like turtles starfish also, nearly impossible earn silver tickets buy specialty fish."
46334,Fishdom,"I used love game....when spending money buying power ups. Now, takes weeks try beat levels. Update: They made updates still ended spending money....which me. Very addictive game!!!!"
46335,Fishdom,Frustrating stuck level days. I get they're hard reason player chance beating without aids. I've stuck level days now. Seriously considering continuing game
46336,Fishdom,"Way many ads 5 lifes, really push sell extra life, detonations go game. For Ok game, give options, tells many fish aquarium, plants u ornaments may have, expensive, I games keeps busy waiting flight connection, flight."
46337,Fishdom,"It's cute, needs improvement. Would better added way skip levels get stuck on, gets boring failing level, I've come close uninstalling due boredom."
46343,Fishdom,"Fantastic gripping game. One suggestion...please make time lives shorter person limited patience, long wait new life reason longer played sadly. Even so, hubby I addicted play together late. Love tanks decorations too."
46351,Fishdom,"The best game ever! My favorite game play! It relaxing, great graphics positive characters talk & other! The contests & new fish fun! Challenging game times hard! I've also enjoyed making new Fishdom friends!! I highly recommend game! A person spend money & still able win levels! Way go Playrix!!!"
46357,Fishdom,"I stuck level upside pyramid gold squares, three months. I'm going give money, I FINALLY WIN level. This supposed fun, calming game. I want to, punch RICH JERKS, IN THE FACE!! Karma get you, I lift finger."
46359,Fishdom,Game fun. Keeps toes. I downloaded new phone start again. I around 190. I disappointed. It take long wen restarted. Fun. Really enjoying game since reinstalled need update need uninstall
46360,Fishdom,"Why free lives disappear time? They'll I open app. As can't 5 lives time I lose first. But I lose first 5 go get ones friends given me, gone. This happens time."
46378,Fishdom,"I think good game. Very addictive. I like idea pay things enhance game, stuck board days end. One example would buying piggy bank, order collect gems already won. How happy hour, like g... Full Review"
46408,Fishdom,"I love interaction charm game provides. However, I spent money stay game find next level even ridiculously unforgiving last. I know idea behind design greed misunderstanding playing game about. Either way, I uninstalling immediately."
46414,Fishdom,"You need add princess fish. Would nice 1 fish least per theme tank. Love Hermie submarine. Also ""+(save octopus) really, way blow up. Sorry octopus. Get rid fish bank"
46420,Fishdom,"I like different color types fish. I'm trying make aquarium colorful without spending lot money! Maybe add advertisement allow replacement money, required things aquariums move game. Things get expensive, thanks! Good story plots lot big challenges require lot thought moved game!"
46422,Fishdom,"Fun expensive want advance meaning either pay lose. It fun game, good graphics easy learn. I think great game serious problem expensive play. If want advance higher levels pay little either. You could blow $50 easy. And earn very, little. You can't earn enough coins power play advance. I know make games expensive. I call quits games get PS 4 would much cheaper. Good luck fun."
46423,Fishdom,"Fishdom bad habit putting icons sales cover free lives friends...be warned! However, Addicted game VERY challenging. Love decorating tanks, collecting beautiful fish amazing decorations."
46424,Fishdom,"It's fun addictive game. If option pay monthly subscription I would join love it(expecting much$ gems then) I love expensive. I collect week two get enough power ups beat levels,.or spend lot money. You piggy bank collect gems buy collection. Beautiful fish graphics movement interaction etc., But expensive"
46425,Fishdom,Always great updates different events do. I refuse rate i've played level 650 played year there's always something makes type game turn fun lame. Fishdom fantastic every update great. Keep good work ya'll n i'll happily keep spending $ game!
46426,Fishdom,"Love..love..love game!!!!! I spend lot time $ playing game. It far best ""free"" game ever. The reason I rate 5 stars this...I made lot ""friends"" Fishdom help sending asking lives. But whatever reason, times I unable get extra lives mail icon there. I thoughts is..I sure almighty dollar plays role. Which sad Like I said..I spend $ time time. I spend lives I KNOW I dozens sitting I can't use. Not cool Playrix..not cool!!"
46427,Fishdom,Good game addictive. But got fed running lives It clays 12 hrs All sudden get message saying lives back little scam
46428,Fishdom,Once longer receive extra lives matter I I stuck level 3 days far. Even going different tanks make difference. Seriously getting fed called improvements
46430,Fishdom,"Game works well, addictive fun comes time spend money levels almost impossible. Not enough moves buy power ups diamonds moves. Also power ups it'll great appear next use. EDIT: So taken every way (except buying real money) diamonds. What way make players waste money."
46431,Fishdom,"Just getting started cute game. Thing frustrating I intend sink money it. If don't, run life can't extend buy tools help difficult puzzles. Gets annoying repeat often, wait mor lives, want buying gems tools. This ""free"" game really free. Hate timed levels!"
46432,Fishdom,"Loved game, never got bored updating June 2018 July 2018 again.. Friends disappear, lives sent friends disappear, many offers/comps/sales. Keep game greed."
46433,Fishdom,"Overall, I enjoy game. But levels exploding timer bubbles way stressful... fun. I dont like I lose life timer runs squids hit net."
46434,Fishdom,"I sign now, game. But still... No videos work. Would possible get videos work? If happens I give full 5 stars. Thank fixing sign problem!"
46435,Fishdom,"Graphics good, reach certain levels, timed levels, game becomes practically impossible beat, without purchases. Was going uninstall, son likes feed fish everyday, leaving that, only. Gets frustrating actually see game working you, make purchase. Will never play again."
46437,Fishdom,I used love game pay play. At first fun addictive go levels 650 can't pass without spending money. So disappointing.
46441,Fishdom,Why must pay diamonds already paid get fishy bank? This unfair. Addictive game.
46442,Fishdom,"I posted ago fact buy power ups, can't progress game. I got really ""helpful"" reply review offering tips beating levels, help section within game. So I tried get reply. The generic tips useless unless new game. Long story short, spend actual money can't get anywhere game end playing level 20 30 times. They want money, end of."
46443,Fishdom,I love game costs lot real money get far. I could purchased quite games I spent far keep own. When I get frustrated I quit playing while. I game tablet well I quite bit farther along game spent money I would care admit...
46444,Fishdom,"I took another star away EXTREMELY slow updating! I can't believe released another update without new aquarium. That's game absurd! Valentine's Day might nice, we've waiting another aquarium since Christmas. I 1/2 million coins nothing spend on, huh? That's reason I taking Stars away."
46445,Fishdom,I would love game wasnt expensive. Its ridiculous amount times ive make purchases. Sadly uninstall cant afford keep topping
46447,Fishdom,Hey guys since last upgrade game freezes starts jittering. Still love game special fish choices.
46448,Fishdom,"Have played game forever seems. The longer play, harder gets win. Loved everything til started changing fish. I love natural real life fish. Don't like new fish enjoy playing more. On 603 level thinking quitting. Doesn't calm more. Still go first aquariums play I enjoyed them. Please knock new type fish. Make new game leave mine alone please Thanks."
46449,Fishdom,I love game mostly money. They dont give us diamonds chance collect diamonds like before. Free diamonds far between. Which makes levels impossible without buying powerups!!!
46450,Fishdom,"Hope u guys make 2018 really top Fishdom year getting rid dratted timed levels! Then I rate stars way!!! **Down 1 star get HELL rid timed levels, go back 5!STILL Waiting get rid dastardly TIMED levels!!! C'mon game designers u read reviews what. 2/5/18"
46451,Fishdom,"Enjoy care timed games. Also lost jewels ""Don't Give Up"" screen. I want quit game, winning one. I think ""Play On"" button NOT green."
46456,Fishdom,"I used really love game changed several ways force buy diamonds, got rid useful rewards stupid vouchers, buy even stupider fish look ridiculous. Then switched swap hand next useless, none high bomb yields coming side events,once vouchers. Whomever created changes sure knows ruin really enjoyable game. But I guess laughing way bank . I hope get greedy ass fired. I uninstalling game thank much."
46457,Fishdom,I love game quite addicting too! I find I'm playing candy crush much playing Fishdom boards keep interested. I care squid boards I hate color time bombs.. I love game bonuses great!
46458,Fishdom,I love game......however hard keep money spend. I spent money cannot anymore. Let us keep diamonds earn! The fishy bank greedy tactic. Give diamonds prizes. How 10 ? Don't stingy!! Listen fans!
46459,Fishdom,"This game fun, sometimes sad fish begging things need pay win games for. And, can't seem win enough games for. It also sad can't talk back fish. I'd enjoy I could buy another fish. Lol"
46461,Fishdom,Cute game. The issue I fact money grabbing game. It's little face spending money it. That's 'bad' thing it.
46462,Fishdom,Cute game. Some levels hard boost lands stupid places wasting boost. Very annoying
46463,Fishdom,The game unreasonably hard near impossible get higher levels. They make purchase! Or forget getting thru it. Told get touch game never replied.
46465,Fishdom,"Its realy fun addictive game. Only fualts events find gliches move forwaed on, especially seahorse one. And always need wifi daily prizes.... Its cool. Another thing stay connected wifi receive daily gifts events. I find quite unfair"
46466,Fishdom,A lot fun appropriately challenging. Lately show internet connection actually good connection. Im sure setting adjust changed cause this. Frustrating. Otherwise great time waster!
46467,Fishdom,"Took yrs game thinking would get better BUT I think better. It's robbery charged diamonds u chance advancing. It's like y'all give many opportunities collecting without buying. Shame really great game! N lil suggestion, bombs lightening bolts things get left board u complete section keep rolled you."
46468,Fishdom,"This game pretty fun good way pass time. The levels get harder impossible. The fish decor cute, too. But best thing customer service. NEVER I experienced mobile game's customer prompt responsive actually helpful."
46472,Fishdom,Cute game love graphics absolutely hate timed levels. I've stuck level 28 past 3 days now. So many times I've gotten last cube time runs out. I hate sinking money many games although I I feel I get money's worth. This game seems make HAVE purchase boosters win certain levels I like games bait that. I'd rather spend money decorations.
46479,Fitbit,"Revising Review!! My #1 issue app, NO place record measurements? I lost many inches, losing scale track inches lost myself, place record inches lost. I'm new fitness Fitbit.

Still hiking/walking 7 miles day 7 weeks!"
46480,Fitbit,I got fitbit yesterday start new fitness regime today. So far I've found great. The issue thousands others I disability can't run ride bike. It would great could alter exercise side things suit.
46481,Fitbit,"It's pretty good, I'm using without fitbit. Tracking seem work map come I've finished, enter either. Others without fit bit problem. I'd also like able select foods make meal rather separate ingredients work manually."
46484,Fitbit,First compatible phone. So sync issues band. There bugs . Whenever I see sleep cycle night ends creating duplicate entries whole log. So 10 night logs 20 entries first 30 second on. Adding calorie intake easy. You first need know many calories had. I install another that.
46494,Fitbit,"Worst app. The analytics anyway painful. Today I trekked Ben Nevis whole period tracked eating battries. Later I finished, simply vanished exercise log. Horrible. Samsung S Health way better app. Not sure invest well app."
46495,Fitbit,"It's decent pairing Fitbit, I've tried recording walk using app, I finish update exercise count. Remarkably useless. Kind defeats purpose even log tell log exercise done. PHENOMENALLY unimpressed, needs work!!!!!!"

46990,Flights,"WARNING! Do want cheapest flights. This ONLY SCANS select number airlines (obviously ones provide click-through commissions). I've inserted travel dates (Australia Europe). On Google Flight webpage, Skyscanner Momondo lowest price $1155. On lowest price $2200 ! $1000 more! USELESS. What scam."

It also would nice pack went 200 instead 150, well opportunities get hints without paying them, like finishing phase pack give us free hint, also make already done oak can't go back redo get free hint save later road.. I truly believe would make addictive give people incentive keep playing higher levels."
47439,Flow Free,"I remember playing years ago gotten better! The thing time, I'm really challenged boards 13x13 up. I would love see packs containing puzzles introduced I've finished currently available ones!"
47441,Flow Free,"Nice game, set idiotic requirements win pay 5 extra themes mappacks I get around since game many levels. What's weird though, unlocking themes cheaper unlocking individually."

47446,Flow Free,"Flow free fun little puzzle solving game great bored need something do. The game ads annoying enough interrupt gameplay removed reasonable price. You also buy level packs, themes hints shop. Originally puzzle hints, started 3 way get free hints unless paid them. Thanks recent update, watch video ad earn free hint. Thanks! The themes alright honestly necessary pay unless care changing colours game. I personally bother these. Theres large amount free levels well premium level packs purchase around £1.50 pay price remove ads unlock (highly recommended). I however feel level packs offer green blue pack really pointless pay feel play like regular level pack. If going levels want people pay for, better offer something different something unique. Anyway great puzzle game, pick fun."
47447,Flow Free,Love it! Been playing game almost 2 years(currently 645 day streak daily puzzles) loved every puzzle every pack! The ONLY complaint wish Big Duck Games would come new packs little frequently(currently gotten perfect every single pack). But complaint reason give game 5 star rating(:
47448,Flow Free,Really enjoy Flow Free Games. Have bought three them. But 13x13 grids (and higher) small fingers. I tend wipe paths I already drawn. Why button locks paths cannot erased unless press Clear button?

47451,Flow Free,"The game like 4 5 star worth game every time completing board, next board button spot, so, course, get used clicking spot. Well every 7n awhile exact spot, 'watch ad' button appears next level button gets moved every then, accidentally it. I feel like done intentionally."
47452,Flow Free,"Forcing honest people take game store contains ENGLISH WORD ""Flow""? That's new low, even copyright trolls. Companies like extinct."
47453,Flow Free,"Crashes constantly. You could sell tickets. Adds helping, probably causing half crashes. So much ""don't evil"", can't get much dark side."
47454,Flow Free,"It addictive mostly captivative. Can look cloud sync- I able resume progress. I Samsung galaxy 2, may help resolve problem find cause."
47455,Flow Free,"A free mobile game play without interrupted distracted ads increasingly rare. In addition, thousands puzzles pay dime for. It's easy run, graphics simple attractive, puzzles range brainless impossible. Just good game."
47456,Flow Free,"Well, amazing simple game. Definitely addicting like puzzles. IN every pack beaten including ones gotta buy newest along 300+ day streak. One best puzzle games there."

47462,Flow Free,"The game fun challenging . The ads aggressive. The hint button easily bumped especially since charged hints price seems rather steep game. Update, I submitted concerns customer outstanding. That alone well worth 5 stars"
47463,Flow Free,I love game. I sad finished levels left. I like streaks would prefer least 30 streaks levels created. This game uninstall getting bit bored waiting updates levels.
47464,Flow Free,"Everything awesome. I played game since I 8. This game life. If it, doing??!! If u write complaint cause love that. Nothing wrong."
47465,Flow Free,Can simple undo button? It's rather annoying start I cross another flow mistakingly. Otherwise I love game aspects.
47466,Flow Free,"I would give 5s ad breaks annoying I admit I would pay it. However, free game, awesome. Totally addictive!"
47467,Flow Free,"I liked game kids lot nice reasoning technique today I saw ads lot... And ads unpleasant, remove phone."
47469,Flow Free,"Addicting game. Ads intrusive. Relatively low cost unlock everything get rid ads once. Overall, great game. Definitely recommend anyone looking game waste minutes hours."

47473,Flow Free,"I play game day everyday keep mind challenged. I never problems graphics. It fun always easy. At first I hard time finding solutions, played quite time I found bit pattern helps solve puzzles now."
47474,Flow Free,"This amazingly addictive game can't quite explain WHY cannot keep playing - yet CANNOT KEEP FROM PLAYING IT! I rarely spend money in-app purchases since I'm limited budget, I gladly one. The designer soul heart ask reasonable amounts rather assuming people hundred dollars waste game app! Keep awesome job, forever loyal fan me! I'm adding games continue long willing make them. :-)"
47475,Flow Free,Finally completed every pack. Took long time I enjoyed. I want puzzle game beat week two. The daily puzzles nice thing wake get brain going day. Bring updates.

Everyone check game find Flow Free worth playing!"
47585,Flow Free,"Was 5 stars. Not anymore. It's unfortunate users aware underhanded addition. It uses data downloading ad files, even paid remove ads. These sit device taking space. leaves cached advertising junk device. It never before. I paid remove ads, yet still push ads device, whether viewed not. Sadly, another company greed took over. This occurring added option view ads get free hints. Whether view ads, they're downloaded. This deposits large amount garbage device, wastes data. This even worse animation update forced fix last failed idea. When people learn leave well enough alone stop driven greed. Now they're screwing users paid remove ads. Always looking squeeze extra penny, cost. If I want view ads, means I want downloaded device. This problem exists versions. Original, Bridges, Hexes, Warps."

47699,Fly Delta,"Works well works. (Use much better). The locks attempting login OnePlus 2 (Previously, worked fine years). However, It run AT&T LG phone. Another example good product broken unrelenting updates. That aside, full html site works fine phones might want pass full html version since robust anyway."
47701,Fly Delta,"I've used domestic international travel- watched baggage, change seats departure, see gate changes get notices flight changes real time landing -- able get boarding passes flight times, today page, good job Delta!!!"
47702,Fly Delta,"Update 7/21 - Still able login latest update (4.13.2). Still freezes spot phone gets hot. This I issues with. Update 5/21 - Still cannot login Oreo version 4.12.2. After entering credentials freezes ""Just moment... Logging in..."". Original - Cannot login upgrade Nougat still cannot upgrade Oreo. Currently running version 4.11"
47703,Fly Delta,Terrible user experience Android. It keeps crashing Galaxy S7 work Huawei. Terrible.
47704,Fly Delta,I wanted current travels. I lot provide away so.
47705,Fly Delta,"I travel work, fix trash I check I need to..."
47706,Fly Delta,"Not great. Log in, check in, electronic boarding pass. If phone screen saver mode, I open, I check get boarding pass qr code...now I take screen shot forget app."
47707,Fly Delta,"Good app, wish nice 3 4 box widget"
47708,Fly Delta,Very easy use!!!
47710,Fly Delta,Very user friendly
47711,Fly Delta,If leave screen boarding info good luck getting back it..... Senseless enter information trying view airport map. Also review sections scrolls keyboard every charter hope stopping want to...
47712,Fly Delta,I found quite buggy. I would get alert Delta saying message I would would show error. It's decent basic functionality gate changes worthless. It's great check-in baggage add-on. I uninstall reinstall I need again. Hopefully time comes bugs kicked it.
47713,Fly Delta,Great unless get logged update changing phone. Delta's password options pain 3 attempts get locked wait hold forever gain access again. Have normal options secure passwords I usual stuff like this.
47714,Fly Delta,"This buggy android. Keeps saying something went wrong, still shows old boarding time even though flight delayed. I'm looking iPhone time issue. Delta needs stop catering Apple, support devices better."
47715,Fly Delta,Would great kept trips crash bugs. During last trip would keep profile trip data. Caused re-add trip multiple times get boarding pass etc. Also frequent crashes requiring restarts. Also could keep checked status. When relaunched would act like I checked flights. Over possibilities clearly bugs needs work.
47716,Fly Delta,"This would update, reporting server error past three days. Also, would lose trip ""Today"" tab, therefore requiring re-enter flight confirmation twice I boarding terminal. I get line get paper boarding pass twice past 3 days travel."
47717,Fly Delta,"When works, great. However, I seem get l locked frequently support call Delta. They solving flight issues issues, takes 2-3 times get rep reset lockout - different password reset (which seems thing know do)."
47718,Fly Delta,The worked great get checked pay checked baggage changed seats chosen splitting group. I dont understand would allow us choose seats chang consent.
47719,Fly Delta,"Cannot log account app, log desktop. No point using locks account load information without getting locked out. Absolutely useless."
47720,Fly Delta,"When flying Delta, even technologically challenged, need app. It lets know carry-on plane, possible gate changes, checks automatically open AND longer print boarding pass; there."
47721,Fly Delta,"6/17/18...the significantly degraded performance. It would 5 stars got stability right. Locks ""loading information"" checking adding bags. Pretty much renders useless anything boarding pass. 4/28 update...app stability improving itinerary refresh appears working now. Used spotty horrible. Let's login load itineraries. Why promote going work? Update**new phone, still horrible. Should pulled store stable reliable. This DM flier using paper."
47722,Fly Delta,A bit cluttered seems always promote upselling. I'd like see ability sync flight reservations Google Calendar offered airline apps. Still pretty easy use.
47723,Fly Delta,Alright I view updates boarding pass. However go airplane mode back data close get refresh. It work check in.
47724,Fly Delta,"Even providing correct information given ticket, unable locate trip I booked. Utter waste time."
47725,Fly Delta,"good Recently stopped working well. Crashes lot, wont let check bags, can't log in. Please get fixed. sucks. Need"
47726,Fly Delta,Works great ACTUALLY need airport. With many people crashed every time. Print boarding passes save hassle.
47727,Fly Delta,"I frequent traveler help save time effort. I able check without waiting line. If changes itinerary, I get push notification immediately"
47728,Fly Delta,allow check therefore cant boarding pass. So irritated rn. Customer needs hr call back.
47729,Fly Delta,"This great... works. I regularly get ""oops!"" messages fails update. This real hassle gate changes updated."
47730,Fly Delta,It takes much digging get useful information. Getting boarding passes flight statuses take couple taps obvious places.
47731,Fly Delta,"Most fine, drives insane I need search trip using confirmation number rather simply listing trips based SkyMiles profile. It's honestly half functionality I require app, I'm sure feature first list development"
47732,Fly Delta,Solid experience. Thanks update show day flights! Next step: 1) Fix random crashes looking seat map 2) More accurate data gate changes standby accepted
47733,Fly Delta,Really really need add ability save boarding pass Google Pay wallet that. How easy win top backlog?
47734,Fly Delta,Worked great I can't even open app. It's constantly force closing. Pretty much useless unless fix it!!!!
47735,Fly Delta,It's great want know happened past. But current updated information help all. I've always ended either calling walking desk.
47736,Fly Delta,"If book car Delta app, booking information appears book car disappears arrival. What?"
47737,Fly Delta,"Buggy. I check in, come back later (at gate) thinks I checked yet. Loading spinners time time."

52504,Gardenscapes,"Edit July 13th: last update ruined game. I cannot play anymore keeping asking give access Fb friends list button work. It's pitty! Love game (i've passed across river) happened ""tap skip""? It great idea worked update only. Now work anymore."
52506,Gardenscapes,"Totally addictive, I stop playing.. I beginning spend money it... Then I reseted phone, reinstall surprise, gold heart still progression gone. I'm back 0. I learn keep hour progression, forced link Facebook. Wich I obviously cause forced. Good point. I'm cured addiction finally able erase it. So best feature force Facebook. Thx gardenscape"
52507,Gardenscapes,"When I started playing, I enjoyed game. Now, constantly asks access Facebook friend list, I want. I Facebook connect save ONLY, bother friends requests sort. If I say ""yes"", go Facebook limit permissions, demands permissions next time I open game. Also, I much farther game, enough ""new"" levels continue earn stars. I play recycled levels, give stars fix garden... whole point game."
52508,Gardenscapes,"Awesome Game! I love Austin! I'm addicted! This great Storyline No timer came relax make way levels redecorating grounds beautiful Mansion! I love different events also, gives Opportunity play kinds different games within Garden! I recommend ages, young old!"
52509,Gardenscapes,"You get prizes gotten considering money spend achieve goals. We need hours play, need power ups. You forget keep items gotten achievements. The areas take many stars things levels area hard. The power ups cost many coins. It Was fun first anymore."
52510,Gardenscapes,"Every update gets better. I've playing long time. Recently factory reset, Facebook. Customer good, got back. Love ads. Yes takes awhile get lives...I three similar games going swap them;)"
52511,Gardenscapes,First oke pass level.. hundred level Need play n again.. hard.. cannot play old level get money need buy (just 4 fun user never buy game money).. lost many times. With new update fun pass level help events. Keep going.
52512,Gardenscapes,"I love puzzles challenging. Game play slowish bad could be. The ads optional awesome, I still watch get coins intrusive since I opt watch. My complaint win unlimited lives forces right then. It problem bc sometimes I time then. I may logged play 5mins since time limit available I time play would better could want to."
52513,Gardenscapes,"Would give 5 levels become hard, used turn would help way, sadly spent 5 days getting past level I losing live. Please change back give us full time workers chance ."
52514,Gardenscapes,"Pretty good far! I purchased coins boosters, receive them. I times. I've never problem, said purchases successful. So took money? And I middle level beat it, ran moves, let get purchase items screen, even though purchased enough coins extra moves. I'd like refunded. Please help fix this! Thanks!"
52515,Gardenscapes,"The game great thought costs much extend 5 moves considering prize coins 50+. Also, several tasks I want gotta do. And I need stars make call greet guest even start new day? The building, though, exciting!"
52516,Gardenscapes,I love concepts Playrix brand games takes WAY long advance get many lives every 30 min. I eventually get bored move on. UPDATE...they've installed many new updates since I wrote post game SO much better!
52517,Gardenscapes,"I feel like butler Austin undressing eyes every puzzle. Also, I'm pretty sure Austin Robbie experimented ""Safe"" Tree House. P.S. FU Olivia! Why gotta Debbie downer Austin's Facebook page? Stop projecting sadness onto Austin. Overall average matching game."
52518,Gardenscapes,Up recently game getting full 5 stars. Until tonight I bought gold reserve used funds get three bonus stuff (3x bombs etc). However I played level using bombs colour wheels egg next level gone. I still 2x instead vanished... fixed I give 5* again?
52519,Gardenscapes,"TOTAL SCAM STEALS MONEY So I swore I would never spend money game. But I enjoyed figured 6.99 hour worth fun worth it, cheaper movie. Problem I'm waitress 6.99 lot money me. So imagine upset I money removed account package I paid given game. Its real shame I delete game u can't justify keeping stole me. Just livid."
52520,Gardenscapes,Enjoying game wish I could can't pass level. What can't get back rounds either? That would help earn coins. I'm basically stuck 29 3 days way get passed it. Not everyone afford pay coins. Please help way. Other than. That great game point
52521,Gardenscapes,"Once get higher levels, game really tried make spend money move on. The level really difficult boosters show useless spots. Also I agree reviews. I want waste stars greeting somebody opening package. Uninstalling right now."
52522,Gardenscapes,My favorite game thus far! Always wanting see what's next tasks improvements garden sections. I also love fact brain find strategies get boards. You stubborn play game I guess I'm stubborn! Lol
52523,Gardenscapes,"This game actually good. But, lives, wait like.....forever (it takes long refill lives). That's play really NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO. But well,, lot things. better waiting lives refilled. Think lot install game."
52524,Gardenscapes,"Got way difficult way soon. Uninstalling hard level 27 something. If difficult frustrating, fun, fun whole point. Plus I like many decorations, I found ugly. And spending star start new day b.s. they're hard earn. I can't imagine getting far enough unlock sections yard without pulling hair out."
52525,Gardenscapes,"Its ok. I like concept all, IMHO, feel game cheats stars continue game. Why forced star ""start new day make call"" slows game lot me. Why pay real money coins earned. Also game charges many coins continue game losing. Almost forcing micro transaction you. 900 coins continue, why? It half that. I would probably buy coins give felt game bit fair. I continue play, like said..i like concept match 3 sim like game."
52526,Gardenscapes,"It's really fun get hard levels, sometimes practically impossible unless spend money. I would keep playing fun addictive I'm done. I spend little money first, cool day 3 everything big takes least 4 stars. I much get stuck I want play pay!"
52527,Gardenscapes,"As addition Austin bucks, I deleting app. I liked microtransactions minimal unobtrusive, gameplay fun, even though levels recycle get higher hundreds, challenges different. Sad update. This favorite app."
52528,Gardenscapes,"3rd edit: seeing I rate game stop asking rate game Edited review - I frustrated first star coin prices stuff difficulty went early game, I get it. I love game. The match 3 aspect changes enough stay interesting narrative amazing. I love little in-game Facebook feed! And cleaning perfect garden."
52529,Gardenscapes,I disappointed you getting bonus start game.. like u get 3 bonus next u lose 4th time u start over. Wish u jus lose like fishdom it... plz fix soon possible else delete
52530,Gardenscapes,"Game usually super fun. Very addicting mentioned. The real bummer me, hard level takes forever get through. Which I'm stuck long, makes want play. But overall, fun game. I love seeing garden transform."
52531,Gardenscapes,Good premise many announcements ts opportunities spend money. If get 30 min free life half used different announcements game. Still doable. Now new way spend coming. Austin bucks. So redecorate already decorated. And I log I let game access Facebook friends list. Ridiculous! I uninstalling.
52532,Gardenscapes,"Great game added propane tanks, would ok computer would generate matches disable. Very frustrating play everytime appear, levels hard enough few, added may almost impossible complete."
52533,Gardenscapes,"Awesome!!! Love game. Just wish gave MORE COINS finishing level. It takes WAY TOO MANY STARS TO FINISH EVERY TASK!!! And sometimes need buy boosters, expensive!!! PLEASE PLAYRIX, WE ALL LOVE THE GAME. JUST HELP US KEEP PLAYING BY LISTENING TO OUR COMMENTS, AND DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT SOOO MANY OF US HAVE WITH THE COINS AND STARS!!!!"
52534,Gardenscapes,"The game whole relaxing rewarding play. While Candy Crush fun, I feel satisfied Gardenscape progress game's levels equate better looking garden. It also helps that, besides competitions give benefits even entering, game real competitive factor besides make yourself. I play worry leaderboards anything like that, great! The beautiful landscape sure sign far come. I also really love music, sounds like kind stuff wake morning to. Austin makes great butler, unflinching dedication craft inspires keep playing, even keep going life extent. The gameplay unique, sometimes I feel graphics look bit... off. Other that, though, I think game keeper."
52535,Gardenscapes,"This game challenging, give opportunity earn time game played earned power icons help get levels games. I've level almost 3 4 weeks. Not fun!"
52536,Gardenscapes,"Been playing now. The good: great graphics. The bad: takes forever load. Too much going game start different quests. And stuck level 65 weeks getting nowhere. So, I can't advance, I quit playing except awhile. I'm good match 3 games, I can't get this. So, I'm uninstalling playing anymore. Why bother?"
52537,Gardenscapes,Game freezes crashes 5 6 times day. Uninstalling reinstalling fix issue. I constantly losing lives boosts That. Just beat super hard level get credit beating it. And... It happened again. Beat level crashed get credit beating it.
52539,Gardenscapes,Its sometimes fun challenging. I feel like sometimes streak win bonuses hurt help. Also opportunity good blast throw rainbow blast middle can't get it. They also give big opportunities end round run moves push purchase order beat level. Sometimes extra hard levels easier regular ones.
52540,Gardenscapes,Getting bit fed hard game is. The game get harder gets. I've passed level 1500 spent 3 weeks supposed easy level see far I could get without spend real money. Couldn't it. It come iPad
52541,Gardenscapes,"It's good first start spending stars making phone calls,feeding dog,and opening packages instead actually restoring garden. Also I think harder levels earn 1 star since tasks start cost do. Ill play 6 levels waste stars pointless tasks like phone call opening suitcase etc."
52542,Gardenscapes,Used love game. I'm 2720's takes week new chapter open 6 7 plays wait another week new chapter open. The treasure chest bad can't earn lives.
52543,Gardenscapes,Edit: There difference challenging ridiculous. When game ridiculous longer fun. Once get certain level every level becomes difficult impossible. Guess time take find something better do.
52544,Gardenscapes,"Edit July 13th: last update ruined game. I cannot play anymore keeping asking give access Fb friends list button work. It's pitty! Love game (i've passed across river) happened ""tap skip""? It gre... Full Review"
52567,Gardenscapes,"I like game relaxing. I like levels, I wish gave coins instead buy I continue level I run turns. I get last turn blame, sorry turns would like continue, press 900 coins continue. I DO buy $2.99 special, get expensive, I'm cutting back."
52569,Gardenscapes,"With last update forces either spend hard earned money buy decoration want get play!! Screw that!!!!! UNLOCK MY GAME!!! Update: Do I get money ""tutorial purchase"" refunded I forced make purchase I DO NOT WANT? Is sell unwanted decoration amount I forced spend decoration order continue game????"
52573,Gardenscapes,"I get game all. You play run-of-the-mill swapping games go boring, pre-set set steps dragging dialog. It advertised letting build garden dreams, gives minimal choices pre-designed set garden. LAME"
52586,Gardenscapes,The game would better stars given larger quantities. Earning 1 star tougher level seem fare. Only play game I run plays games.
52587,Gardenscapes,"Love game gave bad rating cos hard complete levels like htf r u suppose beat level 22 , give us alot moves make buying moves cheaper... like 900 bucks 25 moves 50 10 something alot reasonable... I playing fricken level day considering deleting game. It's fair reasonable. Other good game ideas I'll give better rating"
52589,Gardenscapes,"Love game. One problem. Having jackpot spin wheel, I'm work cannot utilize free three hour play time. Think put aside somehow til able it. Mostly play weekends I free time"
52590,Gardenscapes,I've playing month reached level tells new chapter coming soon. It longer let collect stars us free power ups. I stuck repeating 15 games I want collect points electric show. I extremely disappointed. It fun lasted.
52591,Gardenscapes,I actually enjoyed game lot I expected. And came recent update. Just got I hate it. It literally forcing take away originality put garden design making picking someone else's. Unless I uninstall update play game used be? I'm saying goodbye.
52592,Gardenscapes,"Hate new update. Levels difficult enjoy. Plus, I want tasks nothing decorating. I DONT CARE calling sending package etc. It wastes stars decorating another section! Honestly can't give 2 stars day allowance."
52593,Gardenscapes,"I enjoy playing game I guess main complaint want carry game regular moves run out, 900 coins 5 moves. In games, less coins get 3 tries 5 moves. My complaint spin wheel. It always lands boosters. Again, games give boosters consistent days play. They get better day. At least different."
52594,Gardenscapes,"I'm gonna uninstall game, although I want too. But many bugs game, makes mad. Every time I go play, good, game turns black, leaves, leaving losing life, progress I made. Fix please, I might come back play again. I love playing game."
52595,Gardenscapes,"I give overall 3, I able get week. It says issue shuts down. I love playing game, I can't get open right now. I change opinion fixed."
52596,Gardenscapes,The idea constantly updating game annoying. There option control updates. If could give option would nice. The updates take much data space phone deletes things requires delete items make space. It's annoying bothersome.
52597,Gardenscapes,"If want put money game you. It's fun, I want pay much money. Some parts almost able finish without putting money it. Plus takes forever get much done garden."
52598,Gardenscapes,Don't waste time money. Once reach higher levels ie thousands... game starts load hard (red) levels every round. Thus becoming frustrating hard. The devs game need rework levels unwilling receive constructive criticism. The another company become addicted reliant upon microtransactions. In honesty worked higher levels listened player feedback game would decent worthwhile.
52599,Gardenscapes,"Still think great game, I like different elements story - personally I miss moles! The coins still prohibitively expensive though 900 coins 5 moves get 60 completing level, bit steep."
52600,Gardenscapes,"Absolutely love game, hate got ripped 2 dollars. I bought couple bundles before, automatically went account. Here I 3 hours later waiting stuff show up."
52601,Gardenscapes,It's bit slow progress fast. I see getting bored trying complete difficult levels need loads stars cut trees down. Not enough boosts. It's fun gamt tho
52602,Gardenscapes,"Great game! However, many unnecessary tasks restore garden, goal game. Some levels difficult beat, finally beaten, rewarded frivolous accomplishment. (ex. tea, making call, etc.)"
52603,Gardenscapes,I love graphics whole concept garden animals. My trouble looking keys nearly time earning stars I work garden. Please something I playing game year want continue play it.
52605,Gardenscapes,"You charge much extra moves! The coins level increased. It takes long recharge lives. Please look issues lose player. Other issues, graphics great."
52606,Gardenscapes,"Just add comments Love magic hat, allows move levels free power ups, unfortunately still taking alonnnnng time make progress. Also suggestion receive rainbow power boost last move, allowed play it, could make difference winning round. So far levels able, taking time move level need keep easier interest lost. But saying best game e type. After playing game I found timed rounds almost impossible, boosters get past them. I spoken lot people stopped playing timed rounds. They need taken out. Will soon departing myself."

52614,Gardenscapes,"I've number highest rugby league two weeks. The rewards underwhelming. I way items stay number receive less 10 percent back I used. There better reward system that. I allowed keep unused items I beat level something. I'm level 1546 nothing changes, I'm going continue playing. The rewards worth point. Smh"

52616,Gardenscapes,"I enjoyed rhe game while, although thought required many levels complete tasks. The update I got today July 17th, awful. I want wild west theme spa oasis. It let continue I agree those. I guess good-bye."
52617,Gardenscapes,"I long review, detailing problems Ive game, deleted three times now, forget it. Long story short, fun long-term hardcore gamers, I time sit thirty minutes unskippable event dialogue five minute break play phone games. I never get actually play anymore."
52618,Gardenscapes,I absolutely love game. I playing like year half. You stop asking rate freaking game get 1 star. Yes petty I'm sick asked
52619,Gardenscapes,"Only played couple days far I'm really enjoying it. It's exciting game ever I think meant be. It's actually quite relaxing. The beautiful graphics pleasant music make nice, chill game. Overall, I really complaints."
52620,Gardenscapes,I love game would great compelled update update available play. It wld great option update later still play chose later. Not countries easy access data. Like mine. Therefore cant play days till get data.
52622,Gardenscapes,I love story line. Plus keeps going going. I can't get enough continues challenging hard I want quit playing. I'd recommend anyone. Even kids could play easy enough. Check gatden u get chance.
52623,Gardenscapes,"I used love game - time favorite. Now I can't win level save life. It's ridiculous. I boosters, buy extra lives, ect + I still lose. And anyone plays knows win let win. This game used relaxing - Everytime I play I get stressed out. If change soon, I uninstalling."
52624,Gardenscapes,"Getting annoyed fact I rerate games I rated before, stages dont make sence either. Also, I spend money playing games.... please stop forcing people try spend...."
52625,Gardenscapes,"I really love game, challenging, addicting, I even like story, One problem levels 90 puzzles get real hard win also get whole lot help get first time. Sometimes It takes days get 1. I really hope change us player's good others. But I recommend game."
52626,Gardenscapes,Liked game lot advertised EVERYWHERE. Its annoying. I literally got ad Facebook saying game misses I stopped playing bit. That's invasive.
52627,Gardenscapes,Game used A1. .. however constant cutaways make game play less enjoyable now. Too many sub plots .. fireworks... bonsai trees.. timed levels taking away enjoying game. Suffering development me.
52628,Gardenscapes,"I really like game. But I purchased coins, give me. Even though money taken account. PLEASE TELL ME WHY, IF NOT, I WANT MY MONEY REFUNDED."
52629,Gardenscapes,"I've managed spend hours game without spending cent. There times I get stuck puzzle that's clearly meant power ups, eventually clear luck. I enjoy building gardens mind story 'on rails' speak."
52630,Gardenscapes,"Mostly enjoyable. A levels frustrating. Wish firework contest thing automatically show scoreboard often -- I care that, want play game."
52631,Gardenscapes,"Love game! I wish play ""keys,"" could get stars get farther game. I hate beating levels (or well Fireworks competitions) I wasting time playing keys newer levels ready yet."
52632,Gardenscapes,"The game keeps crashing level. So even I pass level, register. I lose lives I replay it. Gets really tiresome. Other that, I really love game. Probably needs bug fix something."
52633,Gardenscapes,"It's way hard time consuming advance. I really enjoyed graphics story idea 45 levels completing ONE gardens, I uninstall."
52634,Gardenscapes,Although I still enjoy game I find little frustrating pays green dollars can't buy different boosters help harder levels. Instead pays money redecorate Garden I liked way I first time. I also dont like Bonsai miss Orangery.
52635,Gardenscapes,Enjoy playing game. It's great time waster work hard make progress. Found bit clunky times could device. Hate timed games
52636,Gardenscapes,"love graphics, characters different personalities. But enjoy playing game never gets boring. Some levels really difficult that's makes want play even more!"
52637,Gardenscapes,This game supposed casual match three. Far many events. When win 2 hours unlimited play (or heaven forfend 6 hours) burden. And constant contests extremely annoying. If plain ordinary SIMPLE I'd play daily
52638,Gardenscapes,"This game fun promotions like time, makes game interesting. This game best older devices; closes times. Otherwise, nice I play everyday."
52639,Gardenscapes,Your game stinks rigged allow fair play unless dump money it. It's fixed game sucks allows play far. This second time I gave still fail. Never ed r again.
52641,Gardenscapes,Game really good problem whenever finish level conins get r really less nd thus much coins nd can't purchase anything..next option collect coins r buy them. If want buy dan wait complete level. Nd r stuck level game gets boring r playng level only.Please give us options collect coins except buying them.
52642,Gardenscapes,I got level 2068 become unenjoyable now. I constantly wait new lives get stuck level days. The cost boosters/extra lives vs rewards get ridiculous. Reading reviews I see lots people complain things ever change I lead believe really want people playing game I uninstall now.
52643,Gardenscapes,"So far I've right amount difficulty levels. Good way pass time, bit storyline keep involved. It'd nice they'd stop asking rate I already have, though. Yep, another review requested. I sometimes issues moving wrong piece could fingers. They keep demanding repeated reviews I'm going keep lowering number stars."
52644,Garena Free Fire,Please add bolt action Sniper rifles. That would great. The game way easy. And also please decrease amount vehicles per game?

54062,GoBank,Very good. Especially since card came UBER there's extra benefits. Green Dot finally got stuff together GoBank line least UBER drivers. The great. based check cashing disappeared back. Idk came back yet. Easy send money without fees (just forget: cash app/ venmo/PayPal) BTW: Walmart card basically re-skin OF THIS ONE. BUT IT HAS SOME ODD QUIRKS.
54063,GoBank,"Probably best checking, direct deposit, pay bills, send money card I've ever had. No overdraft fees, I get paycheck 1 day everyone company, daily balance alerts, alerts every purchase(optional)and even lets stash money like savings. Just around great card. Free ATM finder charge you. No monthly fee deposits least 500. Can't go wrong here. Love it."
54064,GoBank,"By far best prepaid card I've ever owned!!! If load Walmart, cost dime put cash ATMs great withdrawals every corner! Compared NetSpend outrageous fees charge load card, card knockout! I never another prepaid card ever GOBank card!"
54065,GoBank,"I card like people regular bank debit card. I expecting like much I do.... pleasant surprise. I'm impressed statements, budget builder, even alerts upcoming expenses well deposits. I'm even able paper checks."
54066,GoBank,"This far broken existence. There reason time can't transfer money check transactions/balance. However, happens weekly GoBank. Just get normal bank call day."
54067,GoBank,"Terrible app. It works half time. And usually fails I need most. Not saying that, really true. My money uber needs availing right away sometimes I can't count it."
54068,GoBank,"What's point? Even Chase free direct deposit, branch managers talk issue, gobank have? A phone number never seem locate info hangs you, email address, never works what's point?"
54069,GoBank,I hung call I asked speak supervisor patiently waited one. This person lied said looking supervisor spoke rudely handle questions I had. I've never bank rep hang I asked management. Very rude. I called 9:57am July 6th I treated unprofessionally. I called back three times answer hold cue 25 minutes time forced hang up. This gross abuse time. I report BBB Yelp Google I'm able receive live regarding funds promised yesterday
54070,GoBank,I'm upset...this good I tried deposit check. It tells mobile deposits available account call customer tell I able it. I've updated tried everything help....
54071,GoBank,"Talked Sherry, representatives GoBank. She hung could'nt explain I wait 2 weeks mobile deposit. This situation happened three times prior I done Bank. I recommend bank anybody needs checks readily available them."
54072,GoBank,I keep random charges put card I know they're money. It's extremely difficult complicated get hold anyone help matter send even work correctly
54073,GoBank,"This helpful me; however I move $16 vault account, $16 disappeared nowhere found. This always me, please fix situation soon possible I $16 back"
54074,GoBank,I block account due losing card I've spending past 2 weeks trying get lifted. I followed ALL steps claim recieved email! This absolute worse customer I ever dealt entire life. How I supposed pay things without card simple process getting lost/stolen!!!
54075,GoBank,Site/app tends often! Very suspect. How get access everything until? This throws people's auto bill pay completely!
54076,GoBank,"Cannot access go Bank cannot access money directly deposited paycheck. Uninstalled app, reinstalled work. Call number back card hold 20 minutes nobody picked seems like customer services. (Update) Seems Android operating system update, make sure newest operating system update access work. Still happy card I'm probably going change Banks least real bank customer"
54077,GoBank,keeps taking long load gives error message. Called customer numbers hang you. Was supposed get paid 2 days ago never received deposit. This sucks I'm sending money somewhere else!! Update: say call number back card clearly I said work obviously automated response. It's thing week. I'm going go ahead change deposit asap!
54078,GoBank,"It's easy - I suppose - & helpful banking app's are. Maybe someday it'll biometric sign-in option. Use auxiliary account Über deposits to. Cash back options great indeed, lacking brick & mortar locations person support I see ever using primary bank. Not bad Overall serves purpose supposed to. Waiting biometrics now..."
54079,GoBank,"I like cash back feature I think cash back go directly vault checking account money back build spent also see result benefits getting cash back. ""You made 50 cents, far made total $12 dollars cash back"". Yet can't tell earned much cash back mixed money already checking spend. I know point clear yeah, make cash back go vault appreciate getting back. I'd like see $12 cash back turn $20- 20-$50-50-$100 etc account. .This banking experience good far. It suck organizations consider real bank listed bank. I ended cancelling Wells Fargo account bank America account I happy GoBank free little fees. Then I realized I able continue stocks investments via stash GoBank listed bank. So I money sitting stock I cant move add funds sucks. So I'm keeping GoBank moment I find similar allows continue stocks I may make switch. I may keep bills new funding investments personal spending. I wish GoBank considered real bank businesses/society etc. Especially comes Stash app."
54080,GoBank,Hey ever says experiencing tech difficulties. I found tapping help gping open account backing log page twice allow log transfer..your welcome
54081,GoBank,This show accurate amount balance keep showing thing cannot go anywhere back thing home transfer cannot check balance keep saying stash unstash worst I've seen yet
54082,GoBank,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP. THEY WILL STEAL YOUR DIRECT DEPOSIT AND SAY THEY RECEIVED NOTHING FROM YOUR EMPLOYER. CURRENTLY TAKING LEGAL ACTION. CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS AND LACKS INFO OTHER THAN WHAT YOU KNOW ALREADY.
54083,GoBank,"Is ""instant pay"" uber going ""transferring"" hours end permanent thing? If maybe call instant pay. And also that's case takes day, there's like zero reason instead regular bank card"
54084,GoBank,"9/10 times ""technical difficulties"", usually happens hotline also down. There days time I access account, even check balance."
54085,GoBank,This sucks! I've tried depositing 2 checks thru rejected BOTH! What's point offering something like NEVER works???
54086,GoBank,"Great app!.. especially Uber drivers, allows instant deposit immediate access money! Unfortunately, eliminated half free ATMs...but still make free withdrawals CVS Walgreens...and cash reloads still free Walmart."
54088,GoBank,"Sooo I 200$ taken account I'm home sleeping somewhere I've never been. I called figure things since transaction still pending say can't anything money gone account. My rent $ that. I asked long pending said I wait till July 23. It's July 9. This bank bogus. All saying love problems. Hope experience bs can't nothing you. All left missing money. On top tell came Atlanta, GA 30331. Not place #to place. Then want consider ""REAL"" bank can't help problems currently"
54089,GoBank,This best go bank card drafts much better regular banks... Don't deal people banks.Everything controlled line..I Love It.
54090,GoBank,I used deposit payroll check multi million dollar data company. I'm day 6 without going pending date 3 days now. I gotten payed AGAIN goes through. You can't cancel deposit try call way reach operator. Stick credit union.
54091,GoBank,"Greatest thing ever! Stash money, bank transfers, build budget direct deposit. What's love?"
54092,GoBank,Perfect bank people hate banks. Love card years. Much luv GoBank & Green Dot teams!
54093,GoBank,I'm really disappointed desperate need cash I scammed GoBank company representative I spoke two hours phone get scammed crazy nothing wanna I trying get help
54094,GoBank,I problems traditional banks charging obscene monthly fee's. Gobank answered prayer already saved hundreds dollars.
54095,GoBank,"Had transaction unauth blocked whole account denying access money insisting I wait 7 business days new card. All rep would apologize insist sending new card say anything else, even I requested supervisor. It's absolutely ridiculous I using anymore"
54096,GoBank,"So far working well lately. When try send money someone, hit miss works actually get notified."
54097,GoBank,I never access app. It keeps coming back error everytime I try login. So I call get information account. Highly inconvenient.
54098,GoBank,I actually feel Proud hand debit card cashiers. It looks sleek beautiful. All deposits come intant I've never issue. I even look cards LoL.
54099,GoBank,This work I try cash check says temporary issues end .. I try load cash says temporary issues end im confused working.
54100,GoBank,The ways crashes I need check balance I hate calling checking ugh I'm go rush
54101,GoBank,When works good awhile kicks let login again...so I uninstall reinstall still let login annoying.
54102,GoPro (formerly Capture),"I love concept, every aspect slow buggy. Uploads, preview, connecting camera, amd almost features struggle. I constantly notifications telling uploads cloud process neverend there. I want great I really enjoy Hero 5, great connecting direct PC"
54103,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Only used far, connecting took finally got resetting times. Not sure phone I always seem struggle connect devices. lot features Hero 2018 (the basic one) I imagine feature rich flagship models. Not bad now, we'll see goes."
54104,GoPro (formerly Capture),"This poorly designed obvious bugs. My GoPro reads connected actually complete connection matter many re-starts, closing program, even uninstalling reinstalling it. Very disappointed. Also, support offer page rediculous. It difficult."
54105,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Must agree many here, difficult use, difficult connect Hero 4, camera password, PIN, stubborn connections, connection errors, creating account demanding location services customers simply view videos intrusive rife struggles. Easier simply plug micro SD device. Shame."
54106,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Wow! Total Junk! If hopes reliably controlling accessing GoPro session 5 forget it. Only connects 10% time. The 90% waste 30 minutes trying get connect give up. Complete waste time. Shame them. Crappy, crappy, crappy. Hate app/camera - completely unreliable."
54107,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Can't even connect GoPro, entire point app. I trip coming I purchased hero 6 black trip. When trying connect, says ""connected"" GoPro actually connect app. I can't access footage control GoPro. I know nothing works iOS."
54108,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Terrible app. It's slow, buggy, intuitive requires absolutely useless GoPro account. I care cloud 'service', I want connect make picture, transfer files. But two basic features working well. In end, best way putting SD card laptop."
54109,GoPro (formerly Capture),Hopeless now. I want control camera view I've done. Cant even anymore. Why make things complicated? Back basics please. Until time move gopro
54110,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Somehow works experience poor. You must logged even connect camera. What mobile signal? There fall-back offline, appears couple tens seconds wasted time occasionally. And login useless anyway. It takes ages connect camera turn phone display off, takes another 15s reconnect. It occasionally spams notifications even turned off. And important function connect camera hidden hamburger menu."
54111,GoPro (formerly Capture),"V poor quality software. V intrusive demands & permission set eg location need format SD card? And I need format card often anyway? I bought record aspects MY life, *butt out* GoPro. I really regret buying product saddled junk, spamming software."
54112,GoPro (formerly Capture),"This first review Google Play... The begged it. It's awful. Impossible without creating stupid GoPro account. Even though I tried create (i definitely need it), logging clicking verification link email. Why earth would need internet connection need cloud services?"
54113,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Still terrible leaves regretting choice GoPro competitor's product. I gave star previous version I'm still giving star new phone updated version. You can't control GoPro remote areas phone coverage flight mode can't sign in. Please bring back older version require account, even stripped back version basic controls media transfer capabilities"
54114,GoPro (formerly Capture),Hot garbage. Connecting wifi blue tooth. I pixel2 xl common flagship phone atm h5 session thinks connected app... Look DJI sorted drone hard.
54115,GoPro (formerly Capture),"It two simple things, connecting camera control it. The latter ok, first nightmare. It simply work! I spend time trying get match editing videos. And usability paired GoPro hero6 hilarious. Will go back Xiaomi sonner expected apparently."
54116,GoPro (formerly Capture),"9 10 times says ""cant connect gopro, please try "" tells card ""no media yet"". If rather jump cliff deal Bs"
54117,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Can't connect GoPro Fusion, another gopro, functions like previewing 360 content gives black screens. And worst all: able save 360 photos videos show general gallery app!!"
54118,GoPro (formerly Capture),"The user unfriendly, new update ruined everything. Previously viewing images burst shot time lapse could swipe pictures select best download, play pause time select photo. Requires fix"
54119,GoPro (formerly Capture),"This requires telephone access permission Google Play Services, requires set account, order work all. I need either connect phone GoPro: I want need share pictures Internet. This VERY poor design. A properly designed require extra permissions, provide functions permissions I give it. I know might permissions, I refuse give I could all. I would give 0 stars I could."
54120,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Was quite happy old version, updated newer version whilst countryside found needing create account (on-line) give access location. All unnecessary, info-grab go-pro. No longer happy app."
54121,GoPro (formerly Capture),Live preview camera settings working. Reviewing photos videos work. Proprietary frustrating. Where stitched photos stored? Sharing Facebook Instagram joke. This first experience GoPro I regret buying product. What piece plastic garbage.
54122,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Used love simple app. Can't connect all... And tbh dont time stuff around forums try figure out. You need to. Won't accept password cam. Requires log everyone said already, antithesis grid."
54123,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Terrible, longer works connect camera, previews work. Ridiculously un user friendly.... Pity, gopro used unique product. Now completion usp, even makes brand look poor. Can't see around much longer tbh."
54124,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Connected gopro fusion, go preview photos get blank screen, whole pointless mess. Taking photo works black screen preview. Come guys gear amazing, fix :)"
54125,GoPro (formerly Capture),Samsung s8 paired hero 5 session doesn't work.. connect camera. Wasted hours without progress. And looking reviews wont even bother responding.
54126,GoPro (formerly Capture),No longer connect session 5 Samsung S7. Perfect timing 6 days vacation. This exactly GoPro's stock reputation tanking. Seems like planned obsolescence.
54127,GoPro (formerly Capture),"How could possibly THIS bad? I Pixel 2 XL insanely slow constantly crashes. How? This phone best Android phone market, software stock Android (ie. compatible there's extra stuff get way.) Your needs update right now."
54128,GoPro (formerly Capture),Very disappointed support Android 6+ (API level 23 up) permissions model context requests. It's best practice permission since August 2015!
54129,GoPro (formerly Capture),First impression: kind useless. Location services? So I setup WiFi phone camera? Ten minutes waiting nothing ever showed screen.
54130,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Purchased GoPro Hero 5 Session makes camera absolutely useless. Takes ages connect, lose connectivity regularly, glitches midway recording. Returned camera retailer. Very dissapointing GoPro market leaders."
54132,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Good interface, unreliable extremely slow connect. Momentarily switching cancels connection camera; reconnection usually takes 2 min. Reconnection fail unless process started ""quik"" screen, unnecessary self-advertisement. Connection process can't stopped back button started. Unacceptable need remotely connect start recording quickly."
54133,GoPro (formerly Capture),Literally says connected. Then let anything. I've spent two hours time trying connect. Get right go pro I'm sending back useless me.
54134,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Utter waste time. I give up, takes forever get connected rewarded nothing. Rarely functions properly, sometimes start recording can't stop it. Constantly tells empty 64gig card 3 minutes recording time left. Come GoPro, invest functional app! This seems want sell services."
54135,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Was OK, rubbish: 1.Account required connect camera! 2.Internet connection required view photos! 3.Photo day wallpaper option restored but, fails change unless I open app. Please bring back old Product Manager could appreciate customer perspective."
54136,GoPro (formerly Capture),Pretty Bad execution app. Pairing/Connection process really frustrating. This especially true new Go Pro Camera. Connected couple cameras (three cameras) phone case true camera.
54137,GoPro (formerly Capture),"This sucks! I like take go pro I travel frustrating able remotely access photos! Connecting camera via pc lot better, viable option!! Please, fix basic feature!!!!"
54138,GoPro (formerly Capture),"My God, awful. Useful connectivity camera absolutely non existent. All methods resetting connections help page followed multiple times. Still way connecting. Connects second immediately permanently refuses reconnect, rendering camera controls ability pull video unusable."
54139,GoPro (formerly Capture),Used able access photos/videos etc since updated I can't control camera access files! Very annoying
54140,GoPro (formerly Capture),"Used able pictures quickly share friends. Now crappy ""local"" feature try keep within even implement sharing multiple images once. Bye GoPro"
54141,GoPro (formerly Capture),Can't connect session 5 I phone signal. What the? And need know location? also full useless bloat
54142,Goal Live Scores,"Developers work instant data update in-app statistics. For example, Kane scored 5 goals, showed Ronaldo top scorer 4 goals world cup competition. Then, data changed 2 days. I hope I could explain cool guys make changes. Thanx ;-)"
54143,Goal Live Scores,I select teams events I want follow updates on. Absolutely great abroad travelling stuck work weekend Champions League evening. I also get complete accurate minute results service. Have problem issues integrating home screen.
54144,Goal Live Scores,"Very informative matters footballers I issues architecture! Why reload every time I switch another back it? It's really annoying. Again, ads many persistent! Provide pro version, we'll buy get rid them."
54145,Goal Live Scores,Utter garbage. Just hangs every time I open stops working. At least make stable works. It's nightmare checking scores here. Uninstalling.
54146,Goal Live Scores,"Launches undismissable full-screen ad audio every time launch it. I cope waiting ad timer, blaring audio inexcusable. Good score info though."

54432,Golf Channel,"Crashes. And even open, pops saying needs close every 10 minutes. Sad."
54433,Golf Channel,Takes long load search capabilities look older items without randomly scroll everything....
54434,Golf Channel,It's average app. A lot room improvement. I'm using note 8 crashed 7x within 1 month.

54462,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I gripe although I may completely wrong. I wish like Grint, golfpad gave GHIN complaint handicap. That would great. Shot 84 today , best I've ever played I really think knowing yardages golfpad gives really big reason. Also drop price tags I'd buy them. 100 high screws NFC tag things. I bet costs 50 cents produce one."
54463,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Seems less honest say ""it's free always be"". Had pay $20 get compatiblity Gear watch - find kills battery (couldn't finish 9, let alone 18) info iffy best. Likely (a sucker) renewing unless major improvements occur. IMHO - half baked best."
54464,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I love app. I third year using - first year free version, second year paid Premium version. WORTH EVERY PENNY! I'm still learning take advantage features, game improves. Very accurate GPS shot placement, VERY accurate club recommendations. It guessed better many occasions I chose trust choice. It even adjusts recommendation elevation changes. The strokes gained feature great, statistics keeps. The l play, relevant features become, legitimately help improve game! A feature I'd love see added practice/range mode. Some Disc Golf feature measure throws, allow mark position gps/satellite view, throw disc (or hit ball case) walk it, plot landing spot record distance. It helps track player progress, helps build disc (or club) history, accurate suggestions. One change I'd like see improved hole numbering. If play nine holes 1-9, play front/back order, play course offers 27 holes, always labeled 1-9 1-18 app, even playing 10-18, 19-27, playing front/back order. It would nice see tracked number course, less confusing play, much much easier track looking back rounds later. Overall, EXCELLENT that's good free better paid Premium version."
54465,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Got premium upgrade synch Samsung Gear S2 watch. Started round, second shot I looked watch distance said No GPS. So I look phone. I soon discovered distance shows watch I'd wake phone, defeats purpose smartwatch synch. I problem free golf navi gear, design flaw."
54466,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Reply: that's great, I've done courses mapping feature, must say easy well! Update: I've upgraded premium love it! One request, would love see bantry /skibbereen courses added. They're GPS I figure information there. Thanks. Great app. I've paid premium I'm getting tempted. It's easy gives great stats club course."
54467,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Too many bugs app, hard turn back screen gone sleep even disabling security phone, also purchased GPS tags pair tapping club, time took back previous hole. Hope someone contact resolve issues"
54468,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,Just fantastic golf app. I recently purchased wear os watch disappointed

54484,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I know expect app, frankly I would love find way pair watch I carry phone every shot location. There's got better way track putt distances, I say I'm fairly pleased far. It claims seems bug proof far. It locking screen thing I either yet figure disabling always hate. For now, I'm happy, I'm learning more."
54485,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"This probably best free golf there. That I found. And 18 holes plus playing music, phone 50% thing I found kill battery playing. Seems good"
54486,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"right course, wrong holes. course played 27 holes. allow user choose starting point choice wrong. make sense considering showed location tee box recognized hole playing, hole 600 yards away. guess I'll play old-fashioned way checking yard markers fairways estimating distances."
54487,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"This served well Tags seasons I've issues lately Android 8.1. When phone locked notification bar able pulled without first swiping unlock. When sliding phone pocket pulls bar walking quick settings pushed, like turning flashlight, turning bluetooth, turning data, etc. Please fix this."
54488,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Great app. Im new game, amazing coach well. I Gear 3 cant remember ever using score card. Its app. Club selection great teach new golfers clubs use. Worth money paid version"
54489,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Never used GPS scorecard feature awful,most courses I play unlisted tees inaccurate tees trying add frustrating. Disappointed $20 purchase worth all."
54490,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Easy accurate. It battery app. Just wish auto advance next hole, would perfect."
54491,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Awesome App. Have using last 80 games. Got golf pad tags recently give 'scan tags phone' option, 'link reader'. Very disappointed!"
54492,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I really like keeping track rounds stats sharing social media. I went ahead also got Golf Tags attach clubs saves enter shots manually. I also like Samsung Gear I glance watch, though minor bug always switch back distance display. Fix 5 stars."
54493,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I've using full version since August last year good. Lots useful info help game, especially recommended club yardages take good deal guesswork hitting shots. Suggestions: It would nice lovely infographics app. It easier add 'puttv fringe retrospectively change (and course count putt stats they're putting surface)."
54494,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"I bought tags easy use. It take time get tags gps running, start working, I love them! UPDATE: Great customer support, too! 2nd UPDATE (6/18) - I bought Link I love it! The stats tracking everything 5 stars. Thank you!"
54495,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"Have tried but, far best I've ever had, gives yardage rounds it'll tell club use, even got couple friends get highly recommended thumbs guys"
54496,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,"The thing I would like see added better smartwatch capabilities. It's great gives distance green, would nice watches support could course maps gps's track distance dont need pull phone see hidden hazards, creeks hill."
54498,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,Only played 2 rounds using fir distance green. Very quick use. Additional features may take time get used to.
54499,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,Great GPS score keeper group link tournament leader board unnecessarily hard link.After I created group I visit 11 users individually log times get in. Why hard link? Real pain butt! Leaderboard main reason I everyone get App!
54500,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,Doesn't work well gear s3. Loses signal easily. It's quite annoying. Barely used chore useful.
54501,Golf GPS Rangefinder: Golf Pad,Purchased premium version. Specifically Samsung Gear 2 watch Note 8 phone. nothing problems phone locking watch battery draining within 2 hours. Tried using 4 rounds horrific
54502,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,This updated review. Today (7/29/18) first time using since update. Not fan. It lost round 16th hole. No error exit save popup. Round disappeared. (I concede may operator error.) Unable edit scores easily before. Fonts small read course. LG G6.
54503,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Was 5 star latest upgrade. Harder get favorites screen startup. Scoring hole way harder due scrolling issues. Also seems freeze now, however recover round restarted."
54504,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Previously 5 stars, I using 2 years now. But last two rounds unusable! Constantly freezing telling score card ignoring button presses. I'm going complete reinstall Will try next round currently I feel really disappointed."
54505,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Loved app, latest update ideal. The live yardage upper right great, I issue scoring like users, hesitates trying scroll map. I'm irked shot yardage feature removed free version. Not big deal, upsetting see features removed try force subscriptions."
54506,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Long overdue review app... using years. It's absolute go-to course, especially ones I familiarity. Thanks great ongoing support!"
54507,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Was useful recent upgrade made screen harder read sun, screen way busy, scoring gone haywire. In short new upgrade turned good solution problem app. Either needs fixed deleted. From reading recent reviews would appear developers killed good app. Ok --- SxS response deserves specifics. I'm totally sure going results goofy. Now, I put total strokes number putts. And running total score seemed deduct putts total. I'd love 80 correct, dream on."
54508,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"The update wants upgrade looper membership features used free. I sure I keep using app. I used able track tee shots, penalties, bunkers hit. Perhaps I supposed first place."
54509,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,This 5 star latest update. The open without crashing. I'm longer able all. Super unfortunate I really loved before.
54510,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Great GPS, score card caddy. I've used 3 years love it. Unfortunately latest version caused problems. The Wind shows shots disappears. I opened another I came back game disappeared. I reenter scores - luckily 2 us played 4 holes. I hope fix bugs. I've recommended lots people."
54511,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Avid Golfer - The overall best distances course management / functionality course. Very convenient distances shot tracking. With update, keeping score become bit difficult. Hoping update default score par, straight drive, etc would standard ability tap score I got rather drag right seems ""glitchy"" difficult. Have go back edit scores frequently. Will getting online round summary / functionality back eventually? I find difficult see information round. The online ability see tracked shots review round shot shot fantastic."
54512,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Have always loved app, latest update taken away functionally I paid extra I first bought (Handicap, stapelford scoring, wagers etc... drive accuracy, scoreboard features like penalty shots sand) wanting subscribe monthly fee get back! Poor show Swing By Swing. You've taken money, give back features!"
54513,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,SwingxSwing responsive recent review (2 stars) following significant update APP. They fixed wind feature older version showed direction speed. Thank you. Now updated review tp 4 stars. I agree users addition marketing services related products I want APP. I like <- button return green view fairways view shown specified yardage.
54514,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Usually hole way off, 20 yrds green said 667yds, used shot meter longer older look/ format better"
54515,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Best gps/ scorekeeping i've found yet. Just wish calculated handicap British style USGA style.
54516,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"The working great...but update keeps crashing, issue updating current yardage also issue sending yardage smartwatch (which great update)."
54517,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Thanks response, I can't tell font scoring (strokes, putts, penalties, etc. changed: Seems little small eyes. Great app. 1 GPS seems slower again. 2 My old eyes would love larger font scoring. 3 I reset settings every round. Much improved older phone. GPS got little slower last update"
54518,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,It keeps freezing. It let put handicap in. It tells thinks am. I preferred old score table
54519,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"This best free version golf using 4 years, recently update took away distance front middle back green. Also mistakenly hit back button phone lost scores data round. Before update would save data go back left off. Not big fan updates I likely find new app."
54520,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Latest update good, still cannot share scorecard, still best"
54521,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"After last update I lose lot rounds. Also get ""app broke"" pop time. I uninstalled reinstalled couple times, still working..."
54522,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,The upgrade many bugs. I'm disappointed upgrade. Functions worked work now. Email summary rounds useless. What thinking?
54523,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"After last update, I thought functions gone. It much better. You log & log again."
54524,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Don't love new UI. adding full score card takes way much scrolling around. Takes 3x longer before.
54525,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Love app. Would like able track opponents putts fairways hit too. Any chance update function would much appreciated.
54526,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Where option share round someone else? It seems gone update. I used lot father likes see I'm doing. Please bring back, tell I find it."
54527,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"I'm long time user I promote everyone I play golf with, now. I seriously question developers create actually them. Why run beta test veteran users updating? -my home courses par course rating incorrect -App opens red tees, I noticed round changed white tees edit round screen, hit save take. -Last rounds save handicap list. -Use prompt hole enter score, select enter score. -Hole scoring start par two putts, time I'd hit enter starts birdie putt forcing change time. -The scrolling stinks way sensitive. -I started using cheaters 40 using past 12 years...make font sizes larger majority us older people read it. Any way downgrade previous version?"
54528,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Like changes. The interactive scoring w/ specific characteristics nice touch.
54529,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,3 stars - favourites list work I removed courses list added new ones list refresh displays ones I removed display new ones I added
54530,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Nice app. Don't know pay version free everything weekly golfer needs.
54531,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Last update horrible. Wouldn't anything. Lost last 2 years scores.
54532,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Good yardage score. Should penalties basic version also
54533,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,"Been using several years still pleased it. Easy use, track shots, accurate distances, score entire foursome, lots stats, many features."
54534,Golf GPS by SwingxSwing,Great course! I every time I play anywhere I play. I actually upgraded looper extras. I able know golf game well courses I playing. I love app!

56089,Google News,"I disabled phone. I read lot news wanted try out. However, week I blown 400 MB data plan. My news kind data whole month! Share function designed Crack-head, I share 2 sources always show end list. Why Android 8 different sharing dialogs?"
56090,Google News,"Large photos videos begin automatically. Initially I liked look, scroll lot looking headlines. It took figure settings tap picture top right corner. Turn mini cards disable automatic videos much better. Glad I found I going uninstall go back old version."
56091,Google News,"Still dark mode especially dark widget? And would better widget sizes, one, possibility CHOOSE news widget (and home page). Second thing, news going like two hours ago, three hours, 12 hours. Then three hours. Really? You're light years away News Republic example. And no, I want fill request forum, reviews requests. Will back make dark mode..."
56092,Google News,"The earlier News Weather zillion times better. Minimalistic functional. This gloss substance. Same observations made users. Dark theme, proper list view (not everyone prefers card view). Good widget support. Oh yes please force news reading preferences/ stories upon me. Bring old News Weather back. Uninstalling till features get added/ fixed."
56093,Google News,I fond newstand prior update. The new ui sure looks better I lost connection magazines types articles I liked reading. I enjoyed multitude articles previous version gave me. Now I feel I'm given specifically curated content. Newstand far favorite news app.
56094,Google News,"Well, I think looks nice, like others mentioned, dark mode widget would preferable. Also, concern telling interesting read about. I like kind control indication future news information Google, I think I moving something liking."
56095,Google News,"Best news yet. The stories relevant interests I love I block news sources well. WSJ, NY Times etc make pay read articles sometimes I mistake. Now I block I accidentally try read met pay wall."
56096,Google News,"The brings really interesting news everytime I open article load says error occured I open external browser. This issue occurs oneplus galaxy s7. This really good potential, shame work."
56097,Google News,"Constantly bombarded irrelevant news celebrities, soaps football teams I absolutely interest in. I'm beginning get bored repeatedly 'fewer stories like this' button see articles turn again. I'll give another week removing app."
56098,Google News,"Everything fine, EXCEPT stalls Washington Post paywall, asking subscribe offering link Post's I login. The link work, I unable cet past block. So I going back old ""News Weather"" app, Chrome-based bug. FYI, Samsung Galaxy S2 tablet."
56099,Google News,"The suggested articles great me. I miss ability easily block sources obviously clickbaiters, fine tune pages like sports others, overall good experience. But I also check Quartz, Vox, Flipboard, ProPublica, Politico, Slashdot meta news sites overlooked stories"
56100,Google News,"I've tried ""Hide stories from..."" several sources continue show up. I've also asked see ""Fewer stories like this"" several subjects several times continue see stories related... example, I've asked see 30+ fewer stories Kylie Jenner keep showing up. No offense, Kylie - goings ons news me. Apple News better - available Android"
56102,Google News,"Still filling news feed old unwanted articles. Whatever let users choose article's interested in, keep putting utter garbage newsfeeds. I'd say common sense obviously common."
56103,Google News,"Took good features old news app, cleaned interface, improved ease digging high level subject categories specific topics covered various publications. Also brought back ability ability remove specific sites feed, useful. Conversley, specify prefer cws sites, thought gh appear effective yet. Overall, great news aggregator"
56104,Google News,"Considering Google's expertise search algorithms disappointing. Rather apply machine learning find & refine content web, limited list publishers like many apps. Zite wonderfully promptly acquired big money & killed off. This full embedded trackers. Uninstalling."
56105,Google News,"The design simple yet elegant features, personalized content sharing capabilities, worked well. However, really struggled preform. Not articles take forever load, even scrolling main feed seemed jutter lag. Love content design, preformance."
56106,Google News,Anyway upgrade previous version Google News app? This like early 2000 design. One headline per page color scheme awful. The local news removed. It's alot cumbersome ugly design.
56107,Google News,"While user experience top noch I would love see feature add specific tags/words blacklist I see fkn Trump news headline every day. Please! I want block entire news agencies that, I want dismiss news Trump."
56108,Google News,This puts late night talk show hosts I hate feed. No matter many times I 'show less like this' keep reappearing. Please give 'I want see this' option get rid these.
56109,Google News,"Less news stuff. The refresh rate fast, often refreshing I get read story I want read. This needs redesign incorporate good features News & Weather settings control allow users customize things like refresh rate want see News feed. Google, better mess. Please fix it."
56110,Google News,Not bad. Looks like uses Google news preferences. Still get stories related things I never clicked. If I go Twitter I get stories news I like. Figured show don't. It news I installed I it. But room better
56111,Google News,"After recent issue keeps jumping around. You read article, return main view suddenly back top feed, usually to. Select article. You end opening article multiple times takes forever scroll back were. Sometimes article wanted read gone"
56112,Google News,"Interface looks nice, complete step back every aspect form previous app. The sources seem comprehensive widget barely functional. Biggest issue all, I'm constantly clicking articles widget takes different bloody article."
56113,Google News,"No 'dark' theme? No reason keep installed. My screen darkest setting, laying bed catching things. This impossible use. Wanna know what's better reading Google news? Not staring solid white screen."
56114,Google News,"Such disappointment forced questionable performance old bit Apple. No dark theme insane especially green energy saving world, lack topic editing makes Apple too. Not impressed Google."
56115,Google News,To much advertising makes look tacky desperate. I understand Google employees also eat It's distracting whenever I read news ad appears middle top bottom screen. I feel like I'm reading newspaper from1969.
56116,Google News,Very disappointing compared previous versions absolute battery glutton. It's unresponsive blocking sources. No option never allow location tracking bad considering much battery hog already is. Overall I feel I forced find new newsreader strong statement Nexus & Pixel user.
56117,Google News,"I love news section. But handling magazines embarrassing significantly worse previous version app. Google, I beg you... This embarrassing - doesnt remember position magazine I finished reading I archive magazines I'm done with. Come on!"
56118,Google News,"This absolute best forced news applications I ever experienced! The important thing promotes concept ""Don't Be Evil"" understanding current interpetations ""Don't"" vs. ""Do"" fluid. My worry Google LCC actually part Google."
56119,Google News,"This, replacement Google news & weather, inferior every way. Contains nags including demanding enable location services every time launch it. Lame effort Google's part. It little better new desktop site, I suppose."
56120,Google News,"I like getting news app. It sleek design, really needs dark mode. Also, even setting changed forces articles opened within outside browser. It would really nice opening articles phones default possible. Edit: thanks I'll look it."
56121,Google News,"I article Washington Post, I'm subscriber. It asks log in, I do. It log in, I open WP search article. Not end world annoying. I mean, things work??"
56122,Google News,"It keeps refreshing I'm trying articles, I access top. So many times, I've seen article I'm interested in, I page refreshes bumps back top. Even I scroll quickly try find again, I'm thwarted another refresh. The content great. Wish would let read it."
56123,Google News,A intuitive great except inability open hyperlinks consistently. I constantly see error message 'no supported available' even set let Google News open links. Frustrating I really like app's design ease use.
56124,Google News,"I hate pestered every time I open turn location. I really care much Google thinks improves experience whatever nonsense spouts harvesting usage habits. It's necessary, remember choices I harassed."
56125,Google News,"Update review: resets reading article, annoying. Does give balance coverage news. The algorithm used determine stories viewer sided. Just reject liberal story mean conservative. Opinions indicated summery. Several news articles paid sites indicated summaries. This program seems work better PC mobile."
56126,Google News,"This well made ui intuitive. It provides tons articles. What awful is, despite Google knowing basically everything me, articles subjects I interested, largely facets subjects me. For example, good 70% pieces Donald Trump. I care him, Republicans, Democrats. I interest Hollywood, celebrities, videogames. I get tons articles. I care software development. But I've twenty years. Articles basics C# use. Frankly, hivemind Fark better job greenlighting news me."
56127,Google News,"This used favourite news constantly refreshing fly made pretty much unusable now, since jumps back top list regardless far newsfeed get. Why 'tap update' button like 'Google' I choose I want refresh feed? And I say I'm interested particular subject, stop adding back in!"
56128,Google News,"Great news aggregator! If scroll far down, start see paid content every articles, annoying, avoidable looking ""sponsored content"" statement."
56129,Google News,Love it! My new go news (with OZY). Love way provides full coverage story bunch different sources!

56215,Google PDF Viewer,"Better Google Drive Viewer Google Drive Viewer intercept downloads frustrating. I've looking PDF viewer supports links, hyperlinks links go another page PDF, table contents.

Easier sorting would also nice us thousands photos still need chronological order. The scroll speed allow control. As I start scrolling days suddenly I'm skipping years. It's also shame Snapseed controls built-jn Google Photos (perhaps advanced option). This also needs show patch notes know changed release.
56413,Google Photos,"Google Photos automatically converted photos original quality so-called ""high quality"". It automatically without asking me, quota filled up. This OK.

56436,Google Photos,What f wrong new update. It worsen photo viewing handling experience. It automatically shifted pics wothout order. And worse I'm unable even find pics viewer. I wish older version could come again. It simple easy use.

This sound marketing strategy.

58096,H&M,Horrible customer order app. Had shopping cart full everything got deleted. Called customer number said maintenance try 2 hours. Tried still functioning. Better going store. Get together H&M!
58097,H&M,"Terrible. Keeps crashing start up, get start scanner work, indication article number might be? No 10 digit numbers found anywhere."
58098,H&M,"Perfectly usable shopping. Inuitive interface. Layout organized nice looking. Really needs either much larger maximum capacity ""loved"" item list, separate wishlist."
58099,H&M,"I preferred older version much better. Don't get wrong, h&m awesome, release really step backwards. User interface bit annoying every time select view article clothing go back browsing, start beginning. As in, go back select category, apply search filters, scroll way back were. It's infinitely annoying. Speaking search filters, they're terrible! You narrow searches color?? Who hell decided good idea omit searching size!? I wear XS, (understadably) often stock, able filter vast number clothes fit would greatly appreciated. (Instead disappointed I select item I like find I'm much tiny human able wear it. Makes depressing browsing sessions..) Oh, transferring saved favorites older app? Really? REALLY?? I'm going ASOS. Jk. I love H&M. Though, die hole. A hole almost climb of, teleported way back beginning, chance rescued harness, realize harness actually big it."
58101,H&M,It great stopped working reason.
58103,H&M,Nothing working!
58105,H&M,"like it, nice clothes kfashion"
58106,H&M,I love
58107,H&M,Looks like changed!! I wish I updated! I understand every color item listing! Makes shopping much cumbersome. So much scrolling see thing. If something comes multiple colors I able see listing. Ugh!
58108,H&M,"would even open, tried reinstall- still luck. Was able make purchase I intending on, super bummed. The old favorite shopping app, hopefully gets fixed."
58109,H&M,Just stopped working. Says cannot function without important function/service (reinstalling help)... like cannot function well made. Get grip HM lose even market contenders understand e-commerce works!
58110,H&M,Hate new app! I wish I updated old app. I like can't filter size most. The current filters arent helpdul ans neither clothing listed color. I love clothing probably buying much since easy anymore
58111,H&M,The old better. Also would remove scanner??? Now I get different size I type product code every single time!!?? It's annoying tedious!
58112,H&M,"So bunch glitches. I tried entering promo code full effect, said invalid. Also, said orders $40 free shipping, nothing changed. I order $79 said shipping $3.99. I guess buy store"
58113,H&M,"You filter sale clothes colour ""concept"", size, forces go every single item see correct size. The suits listed separately can't sure trousers match jacket, filter s/m/l etc, chest trouser size. It's annoying, unintuitive awkward. Rubbish. Update 02/01/19. Still can't filter sale items. It'd quicker go H&M shop app. Still rubbish."
58114,H&M,"The whole h&m club seem like good idea, (reason I've downloaded app) staff local h&m even bother asking it, I tend forget honest. Abit pointless."
58115,H&M,I hate 2 weeks waiting items I find NOT getting items I purchased. Waiting outfit MIGHT come TERRIBLE. Fix it!
58116,H&M,"I wish I update !!!! I loved old better thinking new knee going even greater, disappointed . Everytime I item I love , instead leaving I started , brings way back top products! So frustrating. Then I scroll way back I left , that's even I remember scrolling. I'm trying find old cant . The place I shop much . Too much colors, much options. More always best . Simplicity key . Please bring back old . Please!"
58117,H&M,The needs improvement especially checkout let continue checking without entering prefix. You enter phone number optional keeps saying prefix invalid. I Live chat someone talked customer help. Said glitch. Never placed order trying 1 hour. Disappointing.
58118,H&M,"Terrible app. I attempt three times complete purchase, completely emptied cart without completing purchase. Guess want money."
58119,H&M,"great update. But update/new absolute garbage. It took 9 days get order shipped (haven't even received yet I ordered 11 days ago). Let alone shipped I bother Twitter. They said due ""update system"" coincides new app. Also, new layout sucks compared old. Way less intuitive, ""shipping info"" order shipped way less info order old app. Which makes absolutely sense. Before would tell xactly out. Now none that. Seriously, roll back old app. This trash. Base reviews I'm alone. For company big, sold world... This absolutely unacceptable. If order door within days correct (since I see complaints wrong orders) I'm deleting never shopping again."
58120,H&M,"I'm sure exactly happened recently I can't even open bloody since says important unavailable can't function without it, therefore I can't open app. Yes I've installed latest updates problem still occurs."
58121,H&M,The old better. Navigation intuitive. Search filters return submitted requests. Touch navigation lags loading items. All larger file size... try again.
58122,H&M,"I downloaded thinking improvement based reviews I'm looking forward using it. All favorite items disappeared honestly deterred wanting delve new app. I wish old still functionable, I try open I get screen tells new one. Disappointing."
58123,H&M,"Keeps crashing startup ""important function missing"" I never ever access bonus checks. Completely useless.."
58124,H&M,The new awful. I logged back account favorites deleted. Now add back limit many favorites have? This dumb.
58125,H&M,"let register, unless agree marketing material received. According new GDPR regulations, every individual optional selection, mandatory. I know say I opt time, however since new regulation, developers amended feature optional. I'm deleting app..."
58126,H&M,"Very disappointed several occasions I've tried activate offer queue store, repeatedly logs out!!! Very frustrating!!"
58127,H&M,I cannot scan Barcode new says I need turn screen overlay. Hate new passion!!
58128,H&M,All saved favorites gone! Scrolling new interface huge confusing mess point I'm frustrated. The old least favorites!!!
58129,H&M,12 days order. chat work right. crashes time. love products tone purchases make things right.
58130,H&M,What wrong now??? Temporary unavailable due important installed... OMG ..when every installed properly. Fix iT. Please.
58131,H&M,The update really killed ap. Just buy things store. They messed first order 300$ I still trying get $$ back. I merchandise money. I've phone multiple times success refund clothes. Its nearly 2 weeks. Long time customer tempted never shop this.
58132,H&M,The delivery process really slow dont even pick call even customer care support please something regarding
58133,H&M,"says scan store, instructions bogus. There way scan store-- reason I downloaded first place."

58656,HD Widgets,"Great widgets, weather locator longer gets right location me. Every knows exactly I am, puts hour two away real location. Sometimes I can't select preset locations list either, even tho automatic locating disabled. Aside that, great making customized desktops settings shortcuts widgets. I consider must minor tolerable bugs."
58657,HD Widgets,"Very good app. You customise home screen almost exactly want clock, weather & switches widget switches WiFi, Flightmode, etc, etc organised exactly want nice professional looking package. Unfortunately, switches directly turn GPS WiFi etc open default options page, bit sus. It would nice also could add items default weather widgets, ""feels like"" ""wind speed & direction"", etc. While weather page offers sorts useful data, tab weather radar, bit major omission."
58658,HD Widgets,"Can't believe I left review yet. I using years now, first I install I set new phone. I absolutely love look functionality I need. Nice header time/date/weather, full screen weather 5 day forecast vertical switch toggles. Use 3 every phone I bought. Can't recommend enough."
58660,HD Widgets,"Stays ""awake"" Sync w/System Time So far, trying plethora clock/weather widgets, I found (aside Android system clock widget) properly stays sync system title bar clock. All others eventually simply stop updating (yes, I've configured battery optimizations). Then, post found via Google, put this. It works exactly should. Not sure else seems able figure out, I care. Well worth price. (Android 6.0 Blu Vivo XL)."
58661,HD Widgets,"Compared widgets like zooper, uccw, xwidget, kwgt, buzz widget etc.. This joke. And I paid this. It's like free version. 4 font choices can't adjust change anything presets. I'm amazed basic is. I hate I'm way impressed either."
58662,HD Widgets,"Ability blend harmonize settings phone, achieve built look. Or, go crazy it! It's good. And best weather I've ever used. Gets location spot on, Queens, New York Chandler, Arizona, points between."
58663,HD Widgets,Ive using 5 years standalone homescreen always worked great. What id love see support canadian weather services (i.e: weather network). American weather really drops ball region. Thanks HD widgets team keep good work.
58664,HD Widgets,I like widgets available clock frequently stops updating time. I'll go check time frozen previous time. To unfreeze I'll resize little works bit longer. Annoying enough I'm going quit using it. Which sad I paid for. Using ZTE Axon 7. Android 7.1.1
58665,HD Widgets,This latest version takes really long booting come up. I would rather boot cached version update later get blank widget. Also need offer Pixel like widget styles start supporting 1440p res 1080p later 4k
58666,HD Widgets,"The look excellent, lack basic feature The widget look attractive.My problem I keep traveling 3 cities, widget show city. I cannot switch cities widget itself. One issue, I forecast see details refresh forecast, keeps trying refresh forever, unless I exit open again. Once thing I would like have, ability see weather status right lock screen. Must I unlock order see bit public info?"
58667,HD Widgets,"Suddenly, two years Galaxy Note Edge, HD Widgets disappeared screens. Reinstalling gives ""successful"" message, widgets install. Only experiencing HD Widgets. Help I'll give two stars."
58669,HD Widgets,"While tasteful buttons/widgets act odd. For instance, GPS widget opens GPS settings window oppose simply turn on/off. Could anyone look things?"
58670,HD Widgets,recently I'd use.. however travel different time zone.. useless.. refuses read system time creates own.. usually hours current time.. weather.. wth.. 5 star downgraded
58671,HD Widgets,"Used absolute favorite problem free widget. After changing phones OnePlus 5T, nougat Oreo, clock constantly freezes, without reason. Thought setting regards background apps, back default problems continue. Keep messing day I realize time really is. Hopefully fix coming soon. Otherwise 5 stars."
58672,HD Widgets,"Sadly, recent Android updates rendered nearly useless. Still two stars, I loved years, I'm hoping devs update it. Used perfect, quite delay open, lags terribly (gets stuck lot). Aldo crashes completely, minute open. Doesn't update background smoothly used to. Hoping rate high update."
58673,HD Widgets,"Used great, clock widgets longer update time, rendering useless. Would 5 stars gets fixed, considering update since 12-2016, fairly safe assume dev abandoned it."
58674,HD Widgets,"Nobody wants crappy looking home screen, I've tried almost weather market nothing comes close 2 HD.! Plus can't beat accuracy weather information HD! Still best market, needs refresh though keep competition..."
58675,HD Widgets,Clock showing wrong time After last update clock shows wrong time. And single widget I switch WiFi longer turns green wifi
58677,HD Widgets,"Once great, best clock+weather widget abandoned developer even though paid app, fix MAJOR SHOWSTOPPING BUG! Widget clock goes sync shows random time, matter settings apply battery sync section settings. I mean common, show correct time basic required functionality clock widget. Wrote bug report developer review, happily ignored. Such shame , great :("
58678,HD Widgets,Had free version.all good.. paid press weather says error backend failure... figured problem..you need change weather server acvuweather pre set dont work
58680,HD Widgets,Consider Abandoned. As evidenced long took fix Google Permissions issue. Now Devs respond bug questions. Weather longer connecting weather providers scheduled times. Often fails refresh weather even manually. This WAS good app. Sad!
58683,HD Widgets,"When first installed worked really well. Now even pick location let add manually either. Not sure happened?! I uninstalled reinstalled. Still nothing. Sad, I really used love this!"
58684,HD Widgets,design good update time weather update place automatically. Stuck place. Have toggle gps manually first update weather current location. Need update fix issue
58686,HD Widgets,"Have years, worked flawlessly last week. Woke calendar/clock widget gone home screen. I went thru process re-adding widget, saw message saying widget added successfully. Problem - widget (a 4x1) added. I tried various widget configs, none added (even though messages indicated were). Uninstall/re-install, results (widget says added, wasn't)."
58687,HD Widgets,"Pretty nice app. I bought years ago pretty lacking. After playing Beautiful Widgets, nothing really appealed I returned HD Widgets. To surprise, options plentiful I could customize header widget almost way! Promptly uninstalled Accuweather Beautiful Widgets afterwards. I find option save unactive widgets. Would nice feature! 4 stars."
58689,HD Widgets,Old time user app. Been using years I dissatisfied. The widgets comes wide variety different options. With loads customization settings widget ever feel same. Only wish I add. More weather provides hey. Those bad either.
58690,HD Widgets,"I've used Note 4 problem since I bought Note 8 numbers go crazy clock widgets. Constantly rebooting phone get colors back numbers work properly. Developer responded. I've decided notify Google good. Is Developer,dead sick walked away together. I reported Google. Don't want anyone pay can't function properly."
58691,HD Widgets,"Great app...easy set customize liking! Been using long time thought I would try apps..But, came right back one!!! Nothing even came close!"
58692,HD Widgets,Worked great samsung devices UNTIL bought note 8. Now temps match actual weather info location moon sun phases anywhere near correct time day phase displayed. Something definitely screwed here.
58693,HD Widgets,I'm seriously disappointed response dev. The weather icon looks fine preview sized overlaps text info placed home screen. So much paying play store. Wate money time.
58695,HD Widgets,Glad I decided give another chance!! I've tried others nice keep time well!

I would recommend anything pile excuse valuable accurate weather application."
59464,HTC Weather,"problem, now, sudden there's message saying weather unavailable. There's problem internet connection though."
59465,HTC Weather,I can't understand Weather Widget needs keep location services switched work I city listed. Can't get weather information internet city turn location get data sync information? It's nice widget location services much power switched time + they're switched time Google messes power saving mode - keeps switching on..

59496,Hacker's Keyboard,"Some damn fine work. I'm novelist, far best keyboard me. Took second figure configure settings liking that, perfect. I love enable type writer sounds. A true work art! I think I text faster it! Has settings could think more. A clean look 100% free, ads. Thank overall great experience."
59497,Hacker's Keyboard,"Full Credit developer wonderful app. toggle language special feature available rare like this. The work developer puts specially appreciable also layout given . I found ctrol alt keys. I ask developer , whether control alt keys working combination keys. If says works, amazing keyboard. Probably many knows value keyboard special characters. I also came across size keyboard changes portrait landscape. Kudos efforts humanity. Today , search like control keys altkeys, left right arrows. Wow"
59498,Hacker's Keyboard,"There much wonderful app. The variety display options amazing. The infinite language options including Hebrew. The forward & back arrows...genius! It's fabulous app. But almost disqualifying feature: autocorrect works typing word. After typed can't place cursor word get offer spelling options. That means typed word, that's it. Wish would correct & I'd gladly give 5."
59499,Hacker's Keyboard,Thank much simple yet customizable keyboard without unnecessary permission requests. Just small minor thing - add dot double space tap? It would save even time. But - minor probably get used it.
59500,Hacker's Keyboard,"This best keyboard need type exactly want without keyboard getting way. Still Gboard main keyboard autocorrect turned off. Takes getting used to, truly hacker's keyboard. Plenty easy access every symbol ever want need, installing dictionary gives predictive text makes lot easier general keyboard."
59501,Hacker's Keyboard,works great. You hold microphone key get settings. I wish better job predicting words like google keyboard does. Maybe scroll bar act mouse wheel screen would helpful. Don't let name scare away! I might suggestions that's nitpicking
59502,Hacker's Keyboard,"Been using keyboard several months now, still loving it! Responsive, minimal, neat yet offering plenty configurable options. You specifically tell keyboard behave way exactly want! Allows select different keyboard layouts suit screen size(s) orientation. If modify DPI settings want show keys (ie. numbers), keyboard it. If need enter commands terminal (ie. rooted devices), simply flip around get full keyboard functionality. If I get give 10 stars I will! Bloody well done Devs!!"
59503,Hacker's Keyboard,Great! Two suggestion... 1 - Would possible settings option enable extension row default? 2 - Is possibility emoticons using personal messaging? Thanks! These two features would make HK perfect make get rid alternate keyboard apps.
59504,Hacker's Keyboard,"It's amazing, I love it. The thing I would add would fourth layout keys 5-row, numbers right, 4 rows keys vertically short horizontally long landscape mode. Add I'll find way give six stars ;P"
59505,Hacker's Keyboard,"THIS KEYBOARD 'ROCKS'!!!! ""IF"", learn correctly. You must FREE language user dictionary, get better word selection variety. In settings... ""IF"", understand command settings... Look commands Wikepedia BING Search. There BUGS, however, developer, seems stomping out. I'm pleased & HIGHLY recommend care inserting graphic images emoticans."
59506,Hacker's Keyboard,"Update original review. .. Please create Polish language dictionary keyboard!!!! The polish language becoming commonplace Chicago. Years ago, one. Thank kindly! Original review: I using keyboard, along standard keyboards, years. I install every new phone I get also suggest friends. Overall, I love features offers keyboard! It PERFECT DEVELOPERS BUSINESS PROFESSIONALS!!! It would nice see Polish (Polski) dictionary pack added back list available downloadable language packs again. Years ago, available, longer is. I think would awesome option type emoji keyboard added! If 2 requests could met, would amazing! Regardless, I still rate 5 STARS! Thank you, Klaus Weidner, creating best tools available Google Play Store!!!!"
59507,Hacker's Keyboard,"Best Keyboard I've Ever Found! Great keyboard! Not perfect, almost. It would nice could adjust spacing punctuation row. Even important ability override apps, etc., keep fifth row open ALL time! Thanks making this! =^_^="
59508,Hacker's Keyboard,"When I get desktop keyboard like this, I interested beautifully-made fancy keyboard there. Editing Word, Excel, PowerPoint docs much easier. Also editing HTML codes, coding Android phone feels exactly like PC. For Limbo PC Emulator, PC keys work. P.S. I type review using Hacker's Keyboard. I also press ""submit"" button using page key highlights ""submit"", hit enter key."
59509,Hacker's Keyboard,"Definitely standard. Hell yes, lightweight keyboard still manages cram features there. Some preset themes, couple different layouts heck, even ability make appear command taskbar. Even extended keyboards ain't thing, still worth look. Too bad seemingly discontinued. Still, things best left prime. -EDIT: Never mind discontinuation, back. Hell yeah."
59510,Hacker's Keyboard,"/ available 4 row gingerbread layout &lt;&gt; available 5 row medium size layout, essential programming. Symbol suggestions available using like termux gnu root Droid v m. You cannot customize layout default layout lack symbols. And add symbols simple suggestions however know see suggestions least I can't see many apps."
59511,Hacker's Keyboard,"Awesome minimalist keyboard! It nice able hold main keys get punctuations like latest gboard, I live w pressing alt key toggle still. The return key bit big (in 4row gingerbread style), accidentally hit often."
59512,Hacker's Keyboard,"Downloaded 'bout hour ago. So far, I love it. I get used selecting words suggestions bar, automatically adds space used & I'm going re-learn making emojies w/o emoji menu, thats problem since I rarely them. Oh God! How I missed cursor arrows!!!!!! That alone makes best keyboards available. Only HTCs keyboard came close, they've chosen touchpal - garbage, made sheep."
59513,Hacker's Keyboard,"THIS IMPOSES CENSORSHIP ON THE USER. I like fact developer baby-proofed preventing user adding fowl language custom user dictionary. The store anything want, even slang random sequence letters characters BUT WILL NOT STORE WORDS THAT THE DEVELOPER APPARENTLY FINDS OFFENSIVE. Sorry, I like censoring words conversations."
59514,Hacker's Keyboard,I think id THE BEST KEYBOARD available someone needs keys Standard PC Keyboard. I installed VERY infrequent times I need extra keys. I'm retired programmer I know keys need them. I try rest BUT I came back best!
59515,Hacker's Keyboard,"I used hacker's keyboard long time many different devices. I love much I show friends well. But last days, draining battery extreme fashion. reached 36.09% battery drain. killing battery I find new keyboard"
59516,Hacker's Keyboard,While using Dcoder I struggling Google's PC keyboard layout. Although working NOT smooth. Got hold keyboard I'm coder heaven. One thing I would change far I see easy 'delete' key. It would cool could change 'backspace' 'delete'. Either option settings 'shift+' key. Most IDEs auto-complete left either typing closing key arrow around deleting them.
59517,Hacker's Keyboard,"Absolutely wonderful, great emulators like Termux. Only problem autocorrect. With keys crammed keyboard, easy mess up, can't even call autocorrect, autocorrect words. It instead shows suggestions keyboard. Because I can't daily use. Apart that, great tool."
59518,Hacker's Keyboard,"This great but, please, love that's good world, let hide Tab key portrait. I forever hitting I try hit space, places results losing I'm typing altogether. I think I've ever wanted hit key time I've this."
59519,Hacker's Keyboard,"This keyboard awesome ways keyboard supposed be. There swype input best typing real keyboard. Being swype function without doubt extraordinary, reason I came android. But button typing merits well. But forget handed input need two thumbs. ;-)"
59520,Hacker's Keyboard,"Pretty good Quite good. For best I ever used. Yes, I know people complain lack this, that. It's hard please everyone. It even impossible ;-) Maybe even better people comment weak points, criticism shows autor areas should, could improved future releases :-)) Best regards."
59521,Hacker's Keyboard,"Some kind repeat-lock key (graphical display lock state via in-key led (like done shift-lock key)) would helpful. Otherwise 5* ... still idea could done. Think timeout fires, resting touch display, selecting key (or subkey key's micro-menu) way go. What also missing, possibility enter e.g. TAB character keycode via numpad - seem work currently."
59522,Hacker's Keyboard,"If miss hard keyboard, WILL love app. Type passwords without Shift. Made mistake article? No problem, old friends, cursor control keys. This may called hackers keyboard, I call best imitation hard keyboard find."
59523,Hacker's Keyboard,"Has real potential needs improvements. Improvements include arrows keys, ctrl, home, end keys portrait mode. Other improvements could cursor control spacebar swipe, show additional common symbols @#$%&*+ letter keys (access via long hold). Swipe features currently difficult use, autocorrect suggestions conflict symbol suggestions."
59524,Hacker's Keyboard,"I downloaded I could arrow keys, works great! I'm also pleased extensive set options controlling text input works. I mind colored match ICS, take anything away functions."
59525,Hacker's Keyboard,The i've Been Looking For. I've trying Find Advanced Keyboard That Supports PC Keys. I needed Because Installing Windows XP Phone Forgot I Need Keys I tried keyboard app. Controls Bad. But used app. I Successfully Installed Windows XP Phone. I Recommend Developers Download
59526,Hacker's Keyboard,"I got used keyboard originally came phone, disappointed changed system update - trying couple alternatives, I eventually found one, I love it! There many customization options full featured keyboard even includes Ctrl Alt ""keys"" (in landscape mode), still providing clean, simple interface without useless clutter many keyboards insist including."
59527,Hacker's Keyboard,"Using right now. Grows real quick. For instance displays forward slash / fit it. Again fits arrow keys, \ [ ] = autocorrect. I paid ai.type like better. ai.type swype sucks anyways. Oh damn emoji popping least expect reminiscent ms word paper clip. Maybe give new name like grown ups keyboard maybe grups like Star Trek episode."
59528,Hacker's Keyboard,"This keyboard way perfect next version emoji feature added unlike keyboards emoji user apply emojis he/she uses keyboard, pls... Developer favour adding emojis thanks. Nice keyboard though"
59529,Hacker's Keyboard,"It NOT autocorrect.. Most keyboards horrible this, expecting would better... Waste time... All I want keyboard arrow keys exemplary spell checking.. I NOT see spell check autocorrect. So.. Back SwiftKey"
59530,Hacker's Keyboard,"A pretty good full keyboard. No invasive permissions. Autocorrect bit clunky sometimes. Key presses inaccurate, often get row (have screenshot prove it), aiming bottom keys enough work around it. Would nice option force suggestions without autocorrect inputs otherwise disable (like bar)."
59531,Hacker's Keyboard,"Really good keyboard app, especially using emulators needing arrow keys. However two large strikes. 1. No spelling suggestions clicking typed word. 2. No swype support, may deal-breaker comes t'o messaging. A minor 3. No skin/graphical adjustment visuslly customize look keyboard far I tell."
59532,Hacker's Keyboard,"Many keyboards access way many permissions uses vibration editing user defined dictionary. With mind, access anything more, accessing internet GPS, suspicious. Also full keyboard nice touch. The thing weird name. Note, without separate download, autocorrect predictive typing work."
59533,Hacker's Keyboard,"Best keyboard programming. It works like PC keyboard. Thanks giving free. Also thanks giving option change ""Ctrl-a"" (select all) ""Ctrl-Alt-a. I deleted everything mistake many times. This option helpful."
59534,Hacker's Keyboard,"Love keyboard / key 5 row compact mode. Developers, supposed type urls? Please ditch :-) key add /. Would rate 5 stars instead 4 simple change. Please thank great app!"
59535,Hacker's Keyboard,"WTH AFTER TODAYS UPDATE, ALL DOUBLE SPACES TURN DOTS, STOP THIS NUISANCE This brings ease, speed accuracy. Firstly provides arrow button. Beside helps keep caps lock on. This keyboard easy Keys distinctly demarcated."

59701,Hangouts,"Hey creators google hangouts ! Im sure seen friends message thought sure time leave review, dank egg. As friend adressed really missing cowboy ape sticker emojis. We stickers quite frequently feel important apes cowboys included wonderous app, love would much better apes cowboys, thanks epic"
59702,Hangouts,"Hangouts amazing pretty much superior similar system. Aside occasional bugs (which might fault), I absolutely love it. Edit 2/16/18: recently Hangouts lagging bugging out. I'm sure I've taken review 3 stars that. Some time later: sorry phone's fault. It works like dream. 5 stars. Simply great."
59703,Hangouts,"The good parts below; right bad parts. The new update open tap notification. Before (i know now) group messages; would come across messages different people. Now good: I used hangouts long time. Even I actual phone (Google Voice ""phone""). I liked last major update (sometime last year) ties great actual messaging. Definitely good"
59704,Hangouts,"This great app. N thank that. But yeah. It issues. Like last seen. The user might inactive 10 minutes shows active now. N second issue, someone read message not. It clear. N thirdly finally 'typing' icon sometimes work sometimes doesn't. Please fix this. Without issues. This perfect. Thanks."
59705,Hangouts,"There issue OnePlus devices. While video call speaker, opposite person hears voice back speaking. I tested many OnePlus devices multiple high speed 4G networks broadband plan. Pls take look this. This issue thr long time."
59706,Hangouts,The fact can't delete individual message without deleting entire thread insanity. People asking delete button FOR YEARS. Not entire thread simply individual messages. What reason simply wanting please customers; would ignore basic request feature standard every single online messaging ever?
59707,Hangouts,"I love everything app! The thing I'd like see would ability delete/hide pictures another party. Sometimes I want see certain picture person sent I want rude ask delete it. If there's way could possibly fixed, it'd lifesaver!"

59710,Hangouts,"Hangouts still alright. The Project Fi integration useful, that's it. It severely underperforms. It chops text multiple texts receiver piece together. And worse that, MMS terribly compressed. Trying send link? Forget it. If slightly long, Hangouts break link divides single text multiple texts. This ton potential, failed keep up."
59712,Hangouts,"Really buggy compared popular within category. Calls often often gets stuck. After already picked call notification ringing often. Call quality ok. Attachments take forever send, videos (just seconds) taken Hangouts pending dozen minutes, really slow comparing ant messenger."
59713,Hangouts,Hi Google hangouts user self started worded fine me. If updated Resently keep updating beaces might help future app. But also check mobile data Internet connection may cut out. Butif work uninstall reinstall again. If friend issue tell help try somthing else know think work ok Ok Thanks
59714,Hangouts,"Hangouts fantastic messaging calls seriously lacking quality. Very glitchy, video audio cut regularly make difficult understand another call. Other weird glitches regular occurrence well, like ringing sound continuing ring even call answered begun talking. Very frustrating."
59715,Hangouts,I'm wondering someone would instead making regular phone calls regular sms texting phone. I see boyfriend downloaded phone. He recently put phone plan I could see calls cheated. And thing I could think cheat paper trail. Am I correct? When I asked pretends hear says I it. And erase delete call logs text messages there's way knowing talking to?
59716,Hangouts,Hey possible fo add 'delete message' long press? I keep forgetting turn history pissed cause I'm scared dad might look phone yell me.. So PLEASE! Add 'delete message'
59739,Hangouts,To new review!

60131,Harkins Theatres,"Unable all. Have awards number, phone number two passwords cant buy tickets. STUPID."
60132,Harkins Theatres,"When signing says please confirm password second password input, I can't even sign awards."
60133,Harkins Theatres,dine look movies far. I hope learn more.
60135,Harkins Theatres,The old better sucks
60136,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Really, SO Fun! It sucks waiting energy, I mean option buy coins & spend various things including wait, free play RPG games days. However, like HP & little games I would definitely recommend game."
60137,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Be careful spend lot gold. You need progress story. I made mistake spending much pay real money buy some. If happen I would give five stars. Graphics look nice (even things overlap other) storyline bit intriguing. It's fun self Hogwarts, like living childhood dream."
60138,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,I love game. Wish energy would acquired faster instead wait 4 minutes. Wish given option switch houses within first year slytherin house like I merula lackeys would gryffindor instead house make since. Wish chapters would done quicker friend waiting end year 4 nothing do. Also wish game available tablets well.
60139,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"The story great, graphics good, gameplay enjoyable. The way classes run slow make sense. And needs fun activities waiting energy reload. And activities like drinking butterbeer friends options actually learn friends things over. And hidden energy crystals find. Also sorted house instead choosing it. And choices make actually impact story, choices seem impact all."
60140,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"It would far better could play 30 seconds time wait hour half energy refill play another 30 seconds. Otherwise sit around 4 minutes get energy point get low. The whole pay garage even though cheap. I suggest changing get every 2 minutes instead every 4 or, even better, make paid version away microtransactions gives every 1 minute."
60143,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"What kind game asks review paywalls you? This thats what! When HP series gonna get real game? Fanbois get fix content, thats great wanna pay already seen AGAIN. The repeating world Harry Potter."
60144,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Clearly, even though gotten MANY negative reviews; decided nothing make actual game. All tap, wait. Tap wait. That's all. And storyline characters seem forced! Nothing, NOTHING good app. All way Jam City make money. Please, waste time rubbish."
60145,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"There much downtime game. It takes seconds energy points way acquire paying waiting. Having something players interact wait would nice. Other that, graphics great story-line seems good, far."
60147,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,A game amazing potential blocked wait hours continue story line. It's bad enough wait long energy refills energy gone mere 30 seconds. It honestly feels like devs want us play game.
60148,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"okay SO satisfying whoever loves HP universe. however there's still things. it'd wonderful u could actually play full 3d, meaning zoom in/out universe, whole scenes could larger filled something. obviously it'd make game weight slightly larger I guess worthy it."
60149,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"I really like game. The storyline intriguing. Waiting energy sucks though. At least make max more. 25 enough, 30 ish would much better. Maybe make delay shorter too! Something like 2.5 minutes would nice. Overall nice game, decent graphics."
60150,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Okay. This pretty good game. But considering fact wait forever refill energy, fact need energy ANYTHING game, makes want delete it.. also option end lesson passed however many stars need."
60151,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,Glitchy app. You energy wait recharge complete tasks. Energy takes long time refill sometimes progress lost like server record done. Also loses energy I spend I'm playing. Wait times take long too. Decrease wait times take care server/progress tracking issues alright.
60152,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Love concept game, love back Harry Potter world. I DON'T like LONG takes accomplish tasks long takes energy come back. It would great able get task done learning new Potion done without go back 3 times taking day so."
60153,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,Great game! Very addicting. I would given 5 stars easier get energy. You would lot energy almost every mission game. And takes forever energy recharge. I want spend ton real-world money buy energy mobile game. Otherwise I loved it!
60154,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Welcome Hogwarts, sort of. If thought witch wizard would fun, well, get ready study patience, graphics good, gameplay is...well, much game waiting simulator. There alot waiting energy, unless open wallet, kind shameless attempt exploit Hogwarts nostalgia ""Weasley's' way bank account. A shame really I enjoy time I energy spend. In present state kind boring ""click cause not"" slog gameplay. There IS potential here, execution is....wanting Ron different dress robes. Worth look, may keep interest long."
60157,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"I've gotten need wait/pay energy, lesson get attributes lame. My compassion high enough Hagrid invited hut dinner I forced say no. He proceeded tell I hurt feelings. Thanks developers. Getting better updates."
60158,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Year fun enough keep going see happens. Year two needs refinement. Constantly lagging freezing up, never problem I got level. It's hardly playable, though I keep trying hoping get better, luck."
60159,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"This game looked pretty cool, I disappointed, perturbed egregious push micro transactions. The long waiting time energy charge ridiculous. I got quite bored, even I figured I leave classroom, change another pass time, I'm unhappy slow game progresses. It pushes try buying gems, speed gameplay. I buy gems get section, real money translated little payoff game. I played Pokemon Go since came out, I waste plenty time waiting, pay dollars game boost, ridiculous."
60162,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Even wait 4 minutes energy, I like game much. You calculate energy also slows progress - me, that's nice, takes time finish time enjoy! Also temporary quests definitely possible finish without spending money. But can't really choose path - really important story, answers give - maybe get loose house points, story same."
60169,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Really enjoyed game I learned take every opportunity try make pay real money buy gems energy. They make hard case dueling impossible complete without spending game money. I mind slow updates I mostly play pass time. I hope game learn it's, time, many problems."
60170,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"I saw many negative reviews I almost game, I love HP. I able play least 20 min. energy became problem, I RL stuff came back game find full energy. This game fantastic graphics, engaging UI, plotline potential. And free! I think complaints stem expecting much. Don't binge game. Use short time-killer intermittently."
60171,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"A little frustrating. Im year 4, half way through. Can't go further. Its like game made further. I classes anything. Just says patient"
60172,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"It's great game fact takes waaaaaaaaay long replenish energy start barely energy begin with. Unless super patient game player, get app...it drain bank account."
60173,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"This game amazing. The graphic design good better I've seen mobile game app. The conflicts game make gamer want play more. The creativity characters design personality make game good well. This best mobile game I've ever played. Keep good work Jam City, Inc."
60175,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,I love game im still stuck Year 4 chapter 12 controls like wanna go. Also hate fact cant choose friends like need friend choices. We also need pets stuff
60181,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,This game could amazing I spend energy everything goes quickly. I mean really I spend energy roll freaking eyes. And cost way much coins gems anything takes forever get any. Sorry I'm spending money progress game. Maybe get added stuff game play.
60182,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,I'm Harry Potter fan. I absolutely love game. Yes takes energy fill I like otherwise would probably finish game pretty quick. I would keep make game still fun now. People saying taken forever energy full nothing else better 24/7 every minute every day. Personally I love I love things are. I probably vouch sister's too. Keep good work. Also I issue far game hopefully stays way.
60195,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Enjoyed game game reset whatever reason can't get save back. Been playing came I got quite far, know I'm back start data wiped. Any assistance would handy."
60196,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"You enough energy points complete task wait FOREVER energy refill. On top that, I exit game wait energy refill, half time I come back find task progress I made reset I'm starting task again. Game needs major updates. It's kinda fun, fun enough."
60200,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,Been stuck since came out! I love all. But goes back something I already completed I waste time energy! Really annoying. I like get 9 stars open class get 5 stars opened. It takes long time I wait I forget try get five stars. It makes want play tbh.
60201,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,I thinks odd nothing improve get game completed available levels. This waiting able participate current events really sucks puts us disadvantage. There simply nothing do... But wait. Please fix this.
60203,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,The reason I like game I love anything Harry Potter. . But try get buy lot energy get next level/year.. It's really worth playing!!
60204,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"I'm enjoying gameplay, story & mechanics. The latest updates introduced fun ways earn in-game cosmetics, currency & premium currency well. Update: After gem purchase failed, I contacted Devs. They advised contact Google refund payment process failed. They also gave gems goodwill gesture trouble. Nicely handled."
60205,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"What could solid game held back energy system nothing new gaming. However, system game particularly unbalanced. Some recommendations would limit amount energy needed progress classes earn stars, or, make energy replenish quickly rate every 1 minute 30 seonds."
60206,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,Interesting story. But amount energy ridiculous. My constantly resets. I wait eight hours adventure load I log says I need wait another 8...getting frustrated game
60208,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Great game, handles well, I problem. Sometimes (a bit often) I event, I'll certain amount stars I'd leave come back see started star count reduced. It's stunting game progress making wait energy I already used up. This frustrating I want bug fixed. I change rating fixed."
60214,Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery,"Honestly amazing game I'll love story. I given 5, given 4. Here's why, AI awards points houses completely unfair winning house cup literally like dream now. When I commit working many classes possible, night houses go 100 points, there's simply getting 10 points 1 class. I understand game needs challenging, way much."
60217,HauteLook,"Please let turn notifications. I can't stand decide they're going bombard notifications whether like not. I like app, good way get bad rating get uninstalled get fixed."
60218,HauteLook,The working me. It would freeze constantly. Uninstalled installed see there's improvement.

60736,Helix Jump,"Actually really enjoy playing game, however I paid upgraded version without ads still continued get ads. Emailed developer week ago along attached confirmation purchase never got response, therefore I'm giving star. Just lot downloads mean overlook people support game; especially ones voluntarily pay upgraded version."
60737,Helix Jump,"Update: I finally bought premium version avoid ads I'm still getting ads non stop despite reaching devs responded all. Going request refund I guess. Original review: The game fun addicting, many ads. An ad every time restart level, ad beat level, ad blink many times. I know devs make money game free pretty top"
60738,Helix Jump,"Hi VOODOO I issues game I press icon everytime I try go game tablet says 'unfortunately helix jump stopped'. I honestly know game made IOS'S Android. I rated five stars u played friends iPhone really good quality. But seemed work perfectly phone tablet. can, reply comment inform happening. Thank"
60739,Helix Jump,It's good game much need update. There ads die get next level. When I first started play I went straight game. When game front screen thing. Also I got level 4 phones screen went black screen come back. It's good game lot work. Keep good work!
60740,Helix Jump,I love game seems like thing again. It get harder easier. They even change colors repeat them. It's like loop level say different level. Please make challenging get higher game change maybe different color level. Other wise cool I beat like 6 levels 1 hour!
60741,Helix Jump,"Love game - really addictive, could added difficulty levels pass by. My kid plays lot too, I thought ""let's buy full version help developers"". HOWEVER, I paid NO ADDS version, BUT NOTHING CHANGED, adds continue pop usual. Because gets 2 starts :("
60742,Helix Jump,"Ok I enjoying game, fun super addictive. The reason lost star review I keep getting ads middle level, makes lose. I mind ads levels skip 5 seconds cannot deal ads affecting gameplay ruining score."
60743,Helix Jump,"I've enjoyed game, giving poor review someone addresses issue. I paid ads removed almost month ago still receiving numerous ads. I've emailed development team Google play store, received response. If nothing changes I'll delete game together leave review permanently"
60744,Helix Jump,"Easy good. By way, I've noticed saying score hits 6 digits resets 10000. This true, might noticed points lower time, score still 100k+, fill screen up. E.g. I got score 300k, would say 30000. Hope helps people!"
60745,Helix Jump,"This game opinion simple fun addicting time . However variety colors ""trap"" positions limited kin getting boring. There also large amount ads even paying remove . And completely honest, I noticed level easiness canged much AT ALL past atleast 30 levels I've played. There define try change otherwise get attention."
60746,Helix Jump,"Like others I bought ad free version continued receiving ads. Then, I contacted devs response. I tried uninstalling reinstalling app, wondering would fix started way back level 1. So, even though clearly communicating Google Play (taking money problem), saving progress. Done filing refund."
60747,Helix Jump,"The game play good. My issue even though paid money ad free version, still getting ads hell lot ads gameplay. This clear con. Developers, please either remove option go ad free update support this. I dropped email support team refund response far. please look this. otherwise great simple game. Loved it."
60748,Helix Jump,"I really enjoy game. It's great time killer, challenging enough fun. My complaint viewing ad 'second chance', drops right back game, immediately ad closes. It makes 'second chance' kind pointless. I feel brief countdown -- '3, 2, 1' sort thing -- order allow player prepare would improve feature greatly."
60749,Helix Jump,"Way many ads liking. This really good fun game, lose about, 3 rounds, gives ad. And ad sit like five seconds wait over, likely going long ad. Please decrease ads pop expect lot people delete game phone. I read reviews I downloaded game I delete endless amount ads drains phone."
60750,Helix Jump,The ads bug me. When pops I close open again. Takes like 2 seconds. But trying get high score cant close lose score. I think colors better backgrounds would make game exciting playing.
60751,Helix Jump,"This definitely simple yet addictive games I've ever played. Only catch, I paid remove ads yet I still get them. What gives? And said: no, I mean ""second chance"" button fail. Also, ad bottom screen still I play."
60752,Helix Jump,The second chance needs countdown start I've many times starts without warning kills instantly. Plus I think need arrow either side screen rotate with. I keep falling multiple floors time I find thumb keeps getting way. Would nicer arrow bottom corners clear play area.
60753,Helix Jump,"Ok, I love game, much fun I play hours straight. But waayyyy many ads. like every 3 games there's another ad there's ads bottom screen. I'm going pay ads cuz I feel like waste money time many ads game! I understand ads great way display product people show many ads makes want delete app. I mind ad every ten games so. In addition, I think ads bottom screen get way game. Love game though, fix ads."
60754,Helix Jump,"It started great ads tolerable. Lately (on level 30+), I cannot go level without trying open Chrome tab advert (constantly!). This I die, new level, I jumping pass around 30%, it'll randomly open advert phone, even I follow till final pop up, soon I return game, open new one."
60755,Helix Jump,"Game fun addicting, receiving low score many ads. I purchased premium No Ads option nothing changed. I charged purchase, despite trying contact developers 3 times last month I received response. No Ads option SCAM! Please take Ads away give refund!!!"
60757,Helix Jump,"Not bad game start with, I fun competing half unfortunately latest update killed it. Levels became shorter easier meaning I sailed level 40 level 200 rapidly. Ads bearing. Complete level, get two ads. Lose life, another two ads. Half way turn, another ad..."
60759,Helix Jump,"I actually really enjoy game, I agree ads waaaaay many much. But I like game much I willing pay higher-than-average cost ad-free. However, I paid remove ads I still ads. The charge went card, I ""no ads"" button again, anything. And yet.. still ads. I revise review 5 stars ads removed like be."
60760,Helix Jump,"I Would've loved give game better review, Ads Non stop ruin game expierance completely. If I skip second chance ad gives another Ad immediately I start level without reward it, add fact Ads 30 seconds unskippable. Like said, would've loved give higher rating, Ads make unbearable."
60761,Helix Jump,"Simple, fun, addictive asks well made game. So good I paid add-free version. Only reasons get 5 star because, sometimes (when I'm online) I still get ads. Also there's way go back replay competed levels."
60763,Helix Jump,Downloaded game three weeks ago. I totally love it. Im level 64 already (probably good compared some!) score far 11004. Whomever ever created game...well done. Its relaxing way pass free time. It doesnt kill battery phone either.
60764,Helix Jump,"I addicted time. I told myself, I made 1,000,000 points, I would quit playing. I accomplished objective. It fun ride. Nothing seems change game bugs me. I eventually started trying best high scores. Many headaches later, level 1000-something, high score 1,000,000-something, I'm done. It good game. Has anyone else gotten 1,000,000?"
60765,Helix Jump,"I love zenlike game play. I enjoy challenge albeit light skill level needed anyone age 11yo. What I like best I sit play without much thought zone I need to. Don't waste money buying ""ad free"" version. You still get many ads would using free version, thats complaint."
60766,Helix Jump,"DO NOT PAY FOR THIS. I much difficulty trying pay full version. I'm kidding I sat entire day waiting work. When I purchased ad buttons still there, made sounds pressed. I trying find number contact Google tell mad I was. Finally restarting phone fixed it, way I've seen reviews, seems work many people. Therefore, I cannot recommend playing purchasing app. I refund hassle all, I agree reviews answer support email. Everything people say true. Do buy it. UPDATE: seems like I give permissions ask for, continue play ads. It also true ask many permissions. DON'T PLAY THIS! And I definitely ask refund."
60767,Helix Jump,"The game good fun. However allowed astronomical amount ads pop ruins fun try force go ad free. The game fun fun enough spend money make ad free. Due extremely large amount ads trying force us buy game, rate 1/5. Otherwise without ads (some ads understand, like every 20 seconds pop up) would gave 3/5"
60768,Helix Jump,It goodgame kind addictive. There many ads I know whether phone seems lot lag times? The second chance feature count rather throwing straight back in.
60769,Helix Jump,"PAYING TO REMOVE THE ADS DOES NOT WORK! This addicting fun game, issue many ads. As many games I play, I mind spending dollars remove ads... BUT IT DIDN'T REMOVE THE ADS! I still get amount ads, continually banner bottom videos levels. Paying ads nothing. The developer respond, past 48 hours get refund Google. If paying ads actually removed ads, would probably 5 star review!"
60770,Helix Jump,"Game fun. But many ads! They happen lose go next level. I play 5 minutes. And ads close, wait 10-15 seconds time. And encounter add every 30 seconds (you either lose go level)."
60771,Helix Jump,"This game would awesome paid $2.49 remove ads, ads actually removed. And what's permissions? Why need access contacts, location, AND phone calls? And still reply dev? Would better would make buttons work. It even restore."
60772,Helix Jump,Great game many ads. I paid $2.49 ad free I still get many before. Tried contacting developer twice last two days response. This seems happening everyone else well. It would easily 5 stars blatantly rob people supporting content. Contacting Google I hear back Voodoo within next days.
60773,Helix Jump,"Its unbelievable amount adds. The game pretty fun honestly I could play hours end, fact I constantly assaulted adds. There already static add bottom game play choice watch add get new life fine good, top time fail instantly transported add cant get of. Its ridiculous. I spent time trying get adds game play"
60774,Helix Jump,"This game bores never-ending ads. If decide buy NO ADS, charge money ads still stay there, multiplied. Their support never responds emails. If going play offline, fun relaxing game kill time. If need stay online... Then better something else."
60816,Helix Jump,"Actually really enjoy playing game, however I paid upgraded version without ads still continued get ads. Emailed developer week ago along attached confirmation purchase never got response, therefore I'm giving star. Just a... Full Review"
60856,Helix Jump,"It's bad game. Pretty interesting fun. Graphics might need bit optimization stutters happpens drop much. But ads... reduce little bit. And access data, game like wants location, phone info storage permission? Especially run without fine. Be careful guys..."
60857,Helix Jump,Like many people said many times many ads. The gameplay good addictive I decided buy ad free version I still getting ads. I'm sure happening others I contact creators I currently waiting reply.
60858,Helix Jump,This game great except dont like many adds are. I also like dont change up.also second chance sometimes watch says tap restart doesnt even give chance give chance would think would 321 kind thing starts. But still great time passer.
60859,Helix Jump,In honesty I love game. It's nice little game pass time BUT WAY many ads. A good balance would probably levels second chance - there's add every third time lose life. I decided well worth $2.49 eliminate ads - absolutely nothing. My card charged sure enough many ads before.
60860,Helix Jump,"Nice game. But soo annoying get highscore press second chance even give you, watch ad still start again. Also could make endless mode levels could challenges. But could also make die level 12 example, instead different every time restart level. Maybe change colours instead repeating actually change difficulty level 5 easy level 65. Soz, giving tips. Amazing game tho. Must get."
60861,Helix Jump,"Great game. Highly recommended. Had similar game sameness level color game headache. The different level colors nice, although repeat, better colors every level. Each level takes day more, might me, repeating colors bother me. I friend plays game 24/7 loves level 300+! Definitely must get."
60862,Helix Jump,"Paid advertisements, yet I still get consistent advertisements almost every time I restart (and occasionally ads bottom screen). And I aware using extra life plays video regardless whether I paid ads, that's I mean. I paid ads, yet I still ads. The game still pretty fun though. But yeah dont waste money trying remove ads."
60863,Helix Jump,"Half half opinions. For reason whenever I beat high score, 34,000 something, says Helix Jump stopped working. I got 38,546 I passed level 97 I got ad, exited Helix Jump. It happened already 2 times I know why. But game SUPER ADDICTING I love playing. Maybe big glitch I hope creators game could fix..."
60864,Helix Jump,I love game. Its different anything there. Addictive. Easy&Hard time. The bigger screen easier becomes. Ads shows 3 rounds. Ads problem all. As long go back button phone skip almost Ads 5 seconds. I recommend game everyone. Current level 38!
60866,Helix Jump,This game really laggy remade nicely. Also adds non stop like every time pass level. Other wise game really good. It's really entertaining fun play. Also remake copy 1001 games game looks like game also I see front I saw Voodoo h8games please explain.
60867,Helix Jump,This game favourite game ever still lot work on. I never play game I'm connected Internet game lags. Ads every time die pass level much. But game still kinda new I'm going give time. Keep good work!! I would also like say I update game I phone users I I'm samsung?
60868,Helix Jump,"The game great addicting. Seems trending fun play. The game looks easy quite challenging. Also, everybody class phone loves game always plays game lol. Also, ads go malicious constantly reopen. My antivirus says blocked while. Please fix this."
60869,Helix Jump,"Well fun long time started getting really high levels. Say level 700, give 700 points made six digits. It count 100. Then eventually made level 900, even go six digits. After hit 99,999 resets back 10,000. Really thinking deleting knowing I can't break score 6 digits."
60870,Helix Jump,The game enjoyable enough I paid ads removed I still ads despite charged fee remove them. I've sent email VooDoo received response two days. Would rate 5 stars feel like stole money. Edit: Day 11 still ads!
60871,Helix Jump,"Let tell I'm much gamer I heard Helix jump game Store I decide get cuz looked interesting little I know I would fall love game almost immediately. This game addicting much fun play awesome time-killer, great graphics, overall awesome gamer, I really suggest get give shot disappointed I hope developer continues make lovely awesome games keep games coming man."
60872,Helix Jump,This voodoo guy scammer. This second game I pay ads still there. How expect give good review can't figure implement premium paid version. You sure know stick ads everywhere though.
60873,Helix Jump,"The best minimalistic Game ever.. I play forever. Just right amount difficulty satisfyingly so.Never gonna delete game! On side note Dear developer, bugs time time please fix soon. Great job!"
60874,Helix Jump,For reason I payed ads. I close game come back in. WHAT DO I SEE? AN AD AT THE BOTTOM OF MY GAME. I PAYED GOOD MONEY TO ENJOY THIS GAME BUT WHOEVER THE PLEBS ARE THAT MADE THIS GAME DECIDED TO GIVE ME AN AD. #STOPTHEADABUSE
60875,Helix Jump,"I gave star I love game I can't play phone. Every time I press say little box "" unfortunately helix jump stopped"" takes home screen. It addicting can't even get Samsung."
60876,Helix Jump,"The game awesome, I giving 2 stars enormous amount adds get! It intense game freezes trying load adds. I show middle game play. I understand free version expensive adds free version, can't many adds,it's madness. I checked much data take I'm pretty sure drains lot plan."
60877,Helix Jump,"Honestly I would given game 5 star review, I really enjoy love playing it. Unfortunately though, I got sick ads PAID ""no ads"". Well... money taken I still getting ads every level. Tried contact developers fix this, responded email."
60878,Helix Jump,"Actually enjoyable game, however I paid ad-free gameplay still get ads. I've emailed multiple times developers via support email listed got response. However, I realised turn internet connection, ads displayed anyway, I recommend everyone turns internet connection play game, DOES NOT pay ad-free upgrade. This company robbing people."
60879,Helix Jump,Love game great fun addictive. It's good I paid 2.49 get rid adverts there's problem pay still get adverts.update: After emails developer This poor review dont bother reply either. Have reported scam Google hopefully remove adverts paid too.
60880,Helix Jump,"The game good. It's addicting fun play spare time however variation levels played couple levels begins get repetitive. I first downloaded game phone worked well although far many ads particularly considering often long. I attempted tablet however, first even finally even work! Slightly disappointed but, overall actual game fun works."
60881,Helix Jump,This game terrible 1. If go different platform 50% death spot beneath 2.dont even think going super fast mode go 3 platforms there's pretty much 75% death spot 3. All God dam adds God dam every pretty much die three times.
60882,Helix Jump,I really enjoy game great time killer. The reason I rate low I paid ads I still get them. Every 3 times I restart I get ad. I also noticed others issue reply devs. Please give us paid I gladly rate 5 stars.
60883,Helix Jump,"Helix Jump great game. You may get lots ads long gameplay hard levels best played long road trip opinion. It's overall great game! Some physics graphics game could changed enhance gameplay. I look forward new changes VOODOO adding soon, I encourage VOODOO continue work game! I've made way level 350 amount time I play it. It currently favorite game. (If say many ads helpful. Just play wifi data.. turn airplane mode. This remove ads)"
60884,Helix Jump,"This okay, gameplay get laggy sometimes awful. The amount ads game criminal. They give 30 second every single time die. I turn wifi data play normally amount ads affects gameplay."
60885,Helix Jump,"Well, sensitivity option would good, seriously AD every time die ? Theres also banner doesn't let's play since ad playing. The option turn wifi. Also I'm experiencing lags get 3 stairs once."
60886,Helix Jump,"Very fun game, it'll keep busy. The reason I low scoring ad-free version costs money, still shows ads. Another downside reaching support, reply. I've waiting week hear them. Don't buy ad-free version wasting money. If used ad supported games means. To honest, borderline many ads ad supported game."
60887,Helix Jump,"Can tell game would need access photos, location, need mange phone calls? I've played game good bit now. The ad bottom screen tolerable. But I need see 30 second ad every 3 games? Uninstalled."
60888,Helix Jump,"Excellent game satisfying physics easy learn hard master premise. Way many ads, though. An ad gain life fine, showing ad regardless I 'choose' much choice, it?"
60891,Helix Jump,"I liked lot I paid remove ads surprise! You can't second chances anymore all. Otherwise, simple addictive. Just buy ads option -- ripoff since makes ""pay lose"" anything."
60892,Helix Jump,I saw played game friend's phone good. ..but I tried open game stopped working. ...I think compatible version -Jelly Bean- Or phone cannot run -Samsung galaxy grand- Please fix this........BUT THE GAME IS AWESOME. !!!!!!.....
60893,Helix Jump,Definitely giving 3 stars. It's OK. WAY many adds! Makes want play it. I agree fun challenging right want play ads keep coming. I'll probably play little uninstall phone. Not dealing ads.
60894,Helix Jump,I got game kids I loved it. But hated constant ads. So I paid game ad-free still ads. I sent message creator asking please fix refund money. Hours later response game laggy I can't even play!!! Shame u VOODOO!! I liked game. Now I'm deleting it.
60895,Helix Jump,"This game soooo full ads thats impossible play it. In game like die 2000 times get ad every second death. This problem voodoo apps, make hard put much ads it. isnt bad ffs lover ad level"
60976,Helix Jump,"Bought No Ads version, ads still there. Restarted buying No Ads version, ads still there. Is I denied overreaching permissions? There absolutely reason whatsoever would need ANY 3 permissions -- photos, GPS location especially NOT phone call making! Great game, addicting, needs lot work still, removal unnecessary permissions."
60977,Helix Jump,"This game really fun adictive! Do favour INTALL THIS GAME! But small tip makers app, colour choices would great improvment. And little complaint: got around levle forty tapped 'watch add try again' thing watched add would save progress would start levle again. But encountered eror would definitely given five stars!"
60978,Helix Jump,I understand need adverts make money I mind adverts every 10 seconds means I can't actually play game see I like enough buy full version. Very frustrating. Played mins annoying deleting now.
60979,Helix Jump,"Okay guys. I understand everybody needs earn share somehow. But charge ads game I pay, means supply version ads anymore. Not delivering contract linked payment top work out."
60980,Helix Jump,"This game fun good. My problem I paid ad free version still get ads. I reached developer 4 times regarding received response, terrible customer service. DO NOT BUY THE AD FREE ENHANCEMENT"
60981,Helix Jump,I bought ads game (2.49 usd isnt much I go point) still get video ads pop up. I'm talking ones bottom screen ones cover whole screen play. please fix this. scam please refund purchase I report you. (proof youtube channel Camel Cam
60982,Helix Jump,I bought full version watch 15 30 second adds every time passed level died. Still watch adds wait sometimes add. DONT BUY THE FULL VERSION. Im dissapointed never pay games. You guys suck......
60983,Helix Jump,"This game really addictive really fun plz add new things challenging? Because levels thing think u guys make new stuff instead thing level.. oh colors too, u add new colors please.. thank"
60984,Helix Jump,I really like game things I like I level 144 levels get harder! The 2 things I dislike game takes long open glitches much lately I keep dying!!! Other I problems highly recommend this!!! Please fix problems asap
60986,Helix Jump,"This cute, little game helps kill time. My go-to boredom hits pretty much. It also challenging, keeps interesting. I find playing lot. (almost much haha) Anyway, reason I gave four stars amount ads! There many ads, usually strait 45 seconds long. I'd also like know needs access photos?? Overall, great app."
60987,Helix Jump,"Loved game I clicked ""No Ads"" paid $2.49 ads still get also I can't anymore money gone I seriously hate ads. Damn near everytime get done ads! Don't waste money"
60988,Helix Jump,"Like others said, paid remove ads, still getting amount ads. No option refund, like paid do. The No Ads version scam, needs addressed Google game developer. Developer built many ads becomes unplayable, thus driving people pay ads, still getting ads. BEWARE."
60989,Helix Jump,"DON'T PAY FOR ""NO ADS!"" The ads still pop up. Just little less often. I enjoyed game, ads every time die? Way much! And paying ""no ads"" make go away, (still shows image ads even 30 second interactive type ads)."
60990,Helix Jump,"Good, fun game. However, paid fee ads, still get ads. I've billed/charged already still nothing. I tried troubleshooting Google play has, well contacted Google refund. I told need contact game developer (Voodoo) directly. Have reached Voodoo reply. This SECOND Voodoo game issue with."
60991,Helix Jump,"I would rate game higher, I bought ads free version still get tons ads, total ripoff! The game fun, way sign save switch phones progress lost. :("
60992,Helix Jump,Game kinds fun hell would put ad every play? And ads require several seconds two exit buttons get by. I can't think without seeing ad. Guys concerned ads experience.
60993,Helix Jump,Don't even waste time. I got level 101 see anything new would happen. But lousy game level 5 up. Same color schemes random predictable boards. Glad I pay remove ads game probably never get update.
60994,Helix Jump,I enjoy game. Too bad I paid ads option still receive constant pop ads videos. I emailed response either. I'm considering taking legal action nothing happens soon. I want problem fixed I want money back. False advertising serious issue.
60995,Helix Jump,This game addicting. I started playing since like 10 morning right I'm level 12. It's fun. Although I want ball different shape. Like whenever pass level get different shaped ball. And change color shape whenever want. Oh medal award teach level 60 something

Well done developers. My critique regards others mentioned comes either say yes someone order view discover. The likes discover separated overlap now. Other that, fantastic dating app."
62254,Hinge: Dating & Relationships,"This app, I must say, much potential. So well designed. Great idea 3 questions write full bio nonsense. You tell likes right away. Etc. But major hiccups. I delete reinstall pick location properly. I set I working I went home (about 2 hours away) would pick profiles near job. (yes, I changed location preferences) Also, fun swiping left SAME 10 PEOPLE OVER AND OVER FOR DAYS! Download see frustration everyone else having. Maybe better luck area. Not sure."

63098,Homescapes,"This game challenging fun. But apparently many people able pass many levels without cash expenditures levels changed unpassable matter many times play them. Check online. You'll see I'm notice they've done. If deep pockets, game attractive semi entertaining. If want spend lot, plenty match 3 games"
63099,Homescapes,"I've never saw game like before. It's barely possible win two games row without using bonus. The algorithm hard. Some ""easier"" levels harder purple ones... I've also played games dev, hardest. I'm sure try achieve. If like investing real money, really good game. But looking casual game, wrong one."
63103,Homescapes,"I game ages ago totally addicted it. It's fav match 3 kind games there. However phone died I lost progress, way back would good! I've recently started finally back loving it. The graphics good slow phone down. There need spend money possible reach high levels without using coins long patient. And want spend money coins really good offers every again. So far I'm level 110 I think I spent 99p coins ages ago still got many I then. The characters fun gameplay good. Great game"
63104,Homescapes,"It's like many favorite games one! I love story line, play matches, choose favorite furniture, challenge every time.. The graphic nice too.. I Hope Austin hair front head lol bald?"
63105,Homescapes,Been playing game year love it. Only problem I twice payed stuff I received. Just I payed $6.99 charged twice row received nothing. Might uninstall unless problem resolved Changed rating back 5 stars. My money refunded. Thank
63106,Homescapes,"This good game especially break. Some simple tasks like greeting guests, starting new day, picking things, etc requires 2 stars. I also noticed I updated game, unlocked levels gone? Like ballroom area/restaurant like part house kid's room. How so? I hope Playrix acknowledges asked ratings."
63108,Homescapes,"Great first, get hopes progress much first room takes stars complete task levels earn stars become hard complete 5 lives. Sometimes takes days get star even able complete next task"
63110,Homescapes,I think really nice game fun... On hand fact every little thing like answering door talking somebody getting mail play games instead renovating house. I thought game supposed play The Jewel game get stars renovate house. Also there's friend connections share anything like go home help renovate something I think I may interested in. P really good game kids play there's interaction anybody
63111,Homescapes,"The renovations mansion fun. To earn stars reno buy stuff difficult. This way oriented younger players, faster reflexes players ages slower reaction time. Please improves feature games, make accessible earn stars. It game pleasure cause frustrations. The algorythm difficult. It fun spends days level. Not enough lives given difficult levels. It would great types games earn stars. We spend much time trying complete levels enough time enjoying improvements house. Please improve algorithm next upgrade."
63112,Homescapes,"Thought I would like game, disappointed. The match 3 puzzles quite difficult low number given moves. Then 1 star awarded puzzle. At rate, poor Butler parents dead house gets totally renovated lol! I uninstalling game."
63113,Homescapes,bad game waste time everything needs money stars difficult earn tht u get 1 star 50 60 coins thts it. lifes u get chances play u need wait long get full life. heard alot game really upto mark. u cant buy things easily whts point playing waiting game afterall. think discouraging
63117,Homescapes,"The game fun. Unlike kind ""cheat"" you. My frustration redo garden beat levels earn stars projects garden. But give stupid assignments like answer door Lot stars progress slow."
63120,Homescapes,The game OK You complete candy crush type games get stars upgrade house. This annoying games seem impossible win unless put money thegame. You also need hearts play games get free every 30 min. Guess what. You pay also.
63121,Homescapes,It way hard get levels get star level tasks us takes two three four stars. I'm ready uninstall. It fun start levels got hard get through. It's fun get lives level get progress game all.
63122,Homescapes,The levels hard get frustrating times. I wish could boosts end. I want challenge something impossible. It seems like levels set play certain amount times win could week pass level...
63123,Homescapes,"I love game!!!! It best free games get actually great game!!! This game great passing time!! It also addictive fun!! The thing I would change need stars renovate house. But, get play little game. If lose anymore hearts wait refill. Other game awesome!!!"
63124,Homescapes,"I tired taken 4 days finish level. I take coins n I pay them, mention pretty step coins get bombs darn expensive. I think game would awesome stuff high coins."
63125,Homescapes,The game really amazing!! I really luv enjoy playing dis gme.. Graphichs r awesome.... I rate 5 str u guys deserve it... But da upcoming updates possible pls try add wys gain str upgrade buildings.. Cz need str n every work n hav pass level candy crush dats bit kind weird cz im much used candy crush game.. So pls mke every possible things get star eazy ways.... Tq.. Hope u look forward dis pb
63127,Homescapes,"This game used solid playing game, holds back simple win hold piece buy boosters final match. It home scapes, massive gardens I garage fixing bloody car good grief. Just add insult injury added ice bombs already complicated puzzles, come gamers getting stupid"
63128,Homescapes,"It's good first start spending stars making phone calls,feeding cat,and opening packages instead actually renovating mansion. Also I think harder levels earn 1 star since tasks start cost do. Ill play 6 levels waste stars pointless tasks like phone call turning water answering door etc."
63129,Homescapes,"Fun matching game incorporates home design. Levels fairly easy frustrating times. The player often encouraged spend money game boosts coins play without spending money patient. If choose purchase game options, prices pretty reasonable frequent discounts specials. Homescapes 'sequel' Gardenscapes played own. 4 stars due glitchiness unable play unless money spent free lives used."
63131,Homescapes,"Very frustrating I get stuck level DAYS!! I enjoy game, right instance, I'm stuck level even enough red bows get number I need!? This happens often too. Stuck days, win couple stuck days again. I also feel, I power UPS, I I finally win again, can't ever get built levels I get stuck days.."
63133,Homescapes,"This game ok. Some levels hard. And start needing 1 star accomplish something. Then need stars. They stopped 2 star's, If accidentally hit continue. There go coins. It let go back change it. As go levels. It's like candy crush. You stay long time."
63135,Homescapes,This game fun level 498 gotten tedious. Levels take long & constantly require 3 stars finish task. Also I wanted spend months designing garden could stayed w gardenscapes. Unfortunately gonna uninstall avoid aggravation. As many players pointed certain point requires real money ridiculous amounts time move thru storyline.
63136,Homescapes,"When first getting game I thinking would home remodeling type game. Then quickly realized ""another"" puzzle game like rest. Don't get wrong fun kept playing. I thought I would able remodel house, instead mostly using stars taking care bird, cat fish. Oh meeting people. Driving crazy. Just let fix house already."
63137,Homescapes,"I love game much.Once I start spending real money;I make stop playing. But also indication much fun l having. Some best features excellent graphics,fun challenge fun decorating choices.I also liked multiple challenges going - like knitting playing round. I like I work son getting credit parents. Playrix great job making fun games. I started playing couple games,too,and loved them."
63142,Homescapes,"Loved it, wish lives filled little faster. The higher get game gets ridiculously hard spend time redoing levels almost time building house. I'm starting loose interest look games rather.... sadly I loved game much anymore ..."
63147,Homescapes,This game would much better could unlock safe without using really money! I spend hours playing game defeating levels surely coins defeating levels easier get continue playing game. I delete game levels get harder coins available game?
63149,Homescapes,This game set spend money order win. The algorithms game uses determine power strike aid game time. You buy coins order finish levels put situations many times. Don't waste money!
63158,Homescapes,"I like game. But levels hard get even start new day charge 2 star reason. Now I'm level 1369 need 2 stars start new day. What joke ,Its already hard get 1 star imagine 2. Not worth time spend level. The alarm bomb joke 20 moves left colour match. I think time delete game."
63159,Homescapes,Overall good many hard levels allow build awards/stars complete tasks. I want enjoy game feel challenged also want opportunity build rewards complete tasks take time unless purchase made continue wait lives built again. Could throw players bone opportunity build awards. Thanks
63166,Homescapes,"Battery memory usage rocketed recent updates. Killed 30% battery 7 minutes, according Settings. Also regularly (~80% percent time) causes background like Google Play Music close launch due memory usage - something game Pixel 2 XL does."
63170,Homescapes,Like candy crush design choices awful I'm kitchen. I wish would sometimes move little Quicker. My kids love it. Although none us fans stupid stuff like meeting guest decorating cakes. We'd rather Reno stuff. Sounds weird annoys us. Lol
63172,Homescapes,"Dear Playrix, This game apealing. The 1 thing I dnt like hard levels beat , u know, wasting lives . I felt like uninstalling game levels 6 11 I changed mind. I dont like wait 2 hrs 1/2 refill them. It great storyline cute graphics, Captain Flint. Ilike restyle Olivia Williams home. Yours Sincerely, Gamer 1"
63174,Homescapes,I think would great game levels hard. Some levels play ever seems like beat gets point enjoyable. I keep thinking I'm probably going uninstall it. There needs rewards stars things actually help beat harder levels take long beat level. If it'd awesome game.

63296,Honkai Impact 3rd,It's super fun I absolutely love graphics! The game play pretty smooth time action spot on. This easily time favourite mobile games there. The complaint I would things take long load (like starting game going store) I particularly mind since I know large game.
63297,Honkai Impact 3rd,"It let game :/ phone enough space brand new, Samsung s9+. Would love try game looked awesome oh well... UPDATE finally worked next day amazing! So addicting cute, also gameplay actually quite smooth enjoyable."
63298,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Beautiful game. Best mobile game I ever played. What would make even better though, would lots skins, items Valkries. Keep awesome work! Edit: edit rating, WHY DOES EVERYONE GIVE IT 1 STAR BECAUSE IT ASKS FOR YOUR NUMBER? Like, give number enough thots already, what's more?"
63299,Honkai Impact 3rd,"In opinion, thing game needs player player action like PvP like world interact clan members. This game great I love updates keep making better better. It would also great low-end system requirements. Thank amazing work keep up!"
63300,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I respect anime, game amazing! The graphics amazing! When looked first ads, I thought, oh dumb. Then another added, I got it, im addicted it! The girls beautiful, voice acting great too! Of course never played first second, dont get story, say thoughts this, sky deployed warrior girls, different wepons marks, makes intresting game, makes u want pay attention, sit fight, u prepared combos, certain weapons, specific team orders. So games great!"
63301,Honkai Impact 3rd,It's great shame game censored. The affection achievements still exist. Listen people play game release uncensored. Is like something outrages anyway. Also Europeans kids either despite numerous idiots outhere DO NOT play game bother. At least setting censor uncensor game.
63302,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I watch anime, game looked amazing ad I saw day I decided give try - I give billion 5 stars! This game amazing, gameplay really smooth, make new friend every match (at least that's I understood game far, played hour so), simple collect items needed upgrades, definitely best, best game I ever played phone! <333"
63304,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Simply gorgeous. Love game....... What? anything else say? I mean game speaks itself, played it! All aside, bugs like fighting godfather mecha?(is name) Valkyries glitchs starts floating air boss is. Anyyyyway thanks making !"
63305,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Nice polished game, takes awhile getting used controls. It' nice take whole collect n' upgrade type games. Lots stuff beggining run stamina. Been playing two hours, think, got lvl 12, upgrade skills equipment early, really flashy hack n' slash. Cheers, updoot."
63306,Honkai Impact 3rd,"can't get past title screen. says tap anywhere enter, tap screen, stalls little load keeps cycling lift sequence. although looks fun, havent got test out. obvious support options menu, review"
63307,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I normally enjoy types game much addicting whole new level, doesnt drain battery away. Re-Edit: Been playing game really like it, Bronya main would really like abke customize robot, mean, robot model good colors could better opinions"
63308,Honkai Impact 3rd,"It's good game, controls fantastic gameplay smooth. But, bunch little kinks made experience lot worse. For one, explanation game lacking area, stigmatas, gives character stat boost combat bonuses. The English game eh~."
63309,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I'm sure good game I able play long. It looks great game I start mission reading dialogue game closes I restart, keeps closing time. The gameplay bit choppy I play, I blame game this. All problems might I ternet device please fix I enjoy looks amazing game!"
63310,Honkai Impact 3rd,One best mobile games I ever played. Awesome graphics controls smooth butter. It's rewarding in-game purchases completely unnecessary. The levels could bit repetitive get interesting play. Absolutely amazing.
63311,Honkai Impact 3rd,Overall good. Only thing bad camera movement sensitive move well u move character. I'd like movement pad free restrict corner rather anywhere screen (ie. Bleach brave souls). The voice acting best part game!!!
63312,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Simply put, best graphics mobile game. The story interesting combat deep, complex enough. I want console port. This game would perfect controller support. I would pay console. Please could add feature let move resize HUD elements? It kinda gets annoying. Or least add mode removes HUD entirely. EDIT: AS make game look worse without It? Plz fix that."
63313,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I love game. The animation super awesome, And graphics surprisingly amazing mobile. It's super adorable too! Definitely best mobile games there. The fighting system super simple tutorials makes even fun easy use. At times kinda wish game gave bit challenge beginning. Sometimes 'chapters' (missions storyline idk called) easy. Leaving kinda bored continously fighting weaker enemies till ""chapter' 18 so. Normal mode felt like easy mode I like I change first time I played storyline. I also wish characters choose use. Not unlock characters different outfits different powers. So far four generic characters (personality wise, storyline aside). More characters would make game much fun! That's though, game great I highly recommend giving try.♡"
63314,Honkai Impact 3rd,I madly love game. I mean anime girls + monsters = kawaii overload. The graphics top gameplay although bit repetitive. Girls really cute looks. Especially Mei. This game definitely otakus. Would love see anime based game. Waiting eagerly upcoming games.
63315,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Of games I've played mobile game best anime styled graphics. The story game quite deep, even manga light novel game. The problem found similar gatcha game game pay convince, point basically pay win. Free play player never get weapons unless spend crystals, characters oy get grinding free play."
63316,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I've playing month so, honestly BEST games I've ever played.Alot effort put game, game runs smoothly never crashed lagged. There's problem, amount space battery takes ridiculous. My phones battery good I installed game. Even uninstalling game help phones battery, really annoying."
63317,Honkai Impact 3rd,"From graphics, voice acting, story, there's lot makes game well-deserving 5 star rating. Endless events keeps things interesting even decide go farming favorite characters. The thing missing controller support which, least me, would make game even enjoyable."
63318,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I LOVE IT!!! Edit: There's bug game freezes every single time I play I exit game get back whole game freezes point. I still love though please find way fix bug app, really irritating. And I've trying restart 4-7(??) times already."
63320,Honkai Impact 3rd,Pretty disappointed see another mobile game get gutted censorship department localization. Thankfully I'm Chinese I think I'll stick despite perfecting English. Oversensitive western society takes much away.
63321,Honkai Impact 3rd,"This looks like great game! Only problem I really laggy device. I know device game that's creating problem. Uninstalling but, new bug fix comes I would happy reinstall."
63322,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Fun action game really nice graphics. Runs well, I've got S9, better. Kiana cute. The controls responsive handle great. The touch joystick excellent, camera largely goes automatically, except (which thankfully often, drag around manually need to). My real problem far beginning basically really, really long tutorial. You'll probably get groove things long game lets free opens bunch additional, interesting stuff. Also, ""open world"" adventure bits get leveling bit pretty cool really showcase engine lot usual smaller battle arena main missions. tl;dr: cool, intro's bit long tutorial, there's stuff small battle arenas, go play"
63323,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I finished game yet, far really shreds... literally!! Fans hack-and-slash games love this. Smooth controls smashing good graphics, way worth it. I played every day since I downloaded it. Lots rewards too."
63324,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Ask phone number tell necessary again. I dare you. If game nags permission make calls ever again, it'll earn uninstall. Only positive reviews keep immediately. Folks, discerning permissions give apps."
63325,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I love everything game! Except audio through Bluetooth headphones terrible. It gets echoes, choppy really scratchy. Plz fix that!! Great game otherwise feels like console quality."
63326,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I tend hop around mobile games, every time I get one, I always enjoy myself. It's fun game I keep going back to. My complaint occasionally freeze up, kinda kills mood times. Overall, great game play. The added adventure mode also something behold."
63327,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Amazingly good! Gameplay superb mobile controls graphics beautiful like made heaven. No intrusive advertisements in-app purchases required still kick butt fun! Try it, might like it."
63328,Honkai Impact 3rd,The graphics really nice story great overall game play SUGOI weaboo definitely try game. The thing I want changed offline mode case u internet
63329,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Updated review. Gameplay wise, tight controls, graphics great. The thing bogs arbitrary, horrible gacha system. Normally, problem, latest Mike expansion clear sign bad gacha design. I get trying get money people, placing trash Valkyries focus expansion major kick teeth. Actually makes stop playing game."
63330,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I absolutely despise, loathe core mobile (on smart phones) gaming. A waste time IMO game addicting say least. Fun core, great fightingechanics never repetitive awesome events missions."
63331,Honkai Impact 3rd,A really great free play game run it. Never mind. Changing score I found company decided acceptable nationality. Such shame too. Would 5/5 game silly censorship.
63332,Honkai Impact 3rd,"I'm sure say, looked like anime type game I can't stop playing it. It really good graphics, I like gameplay, I like fighting. And I make friends people I even know I'm really bad making friends."
63333,Honkai Impact 3rd,It's Great Game! I'm issue starting up.. whenever says tap anywhere enter game loads stops go's back start game.. pls help!!
63334,Honkai Impact 3rd,Awesome. Was expecting much variety characters types missions go on. Lots different enemies things dont get stale!
63335,Honkai Impact 3rd,"Can't believe phone game looks good... Frenetic fun game play, plot is... Not amazing, nobody lol. Only thing I wish would add male characters. Still--Easily best mobile game I've played."
63376,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,Used tracking flight prices two weeks intended departure. It suggested I wait week prices would drop. Prices increased every day finally suggested I purchase $200 higher I first checked. Ended finding better prices app. Maybe better planning months advance?
63377,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"A friend told hopper travel often, n can't see travelling without watching flights first. I everyone I know also."
63378,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"I book flights track flight prices good that. The two options basic fares (Y/N) layover length (short/long). Would give 5 stars I could options like... include/exclude specific airlines, pick many stops I want max, etc."
63379,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,Awful customer support. Had number changed unforeseen circumstances way log change password number made account. So I can't go back booking better customer support email. Which expect quick reply.
63380,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"The first try enough me. I like idea concept, national airline country (Montenegro) even list flights I it. It shows 40% expensive flight Rome Podgorica predicts fall 190e, everywhere else currently cc 160e."
63381,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,I've trying give fair chance. I watching price tells price always higher says wait. I look search I find significant difference price always lower. I'm sure they're pulling numbers app. Besides easy use.
63383,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,Honestly waste time. I always saw ads YouTube whatnot I gave try I always found way cheaper tickets
63384,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"The claims seen price particular flight low 5 months I book now, however I fly routes time ALWAYS cost 20% less hoppers best price."
63385,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"Great concept, poor execution. The alerts constantly tell wait wait wait booking. Woke morning alert prices escalated come down. Most expensive free store."
63386,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"Has hidden charges. Could end paying check luggage $25-$60 per bag. Some flights DO NOT include CARRY-ON bag. I flew Texas, flight baggage normal. On way back, ticket almost twice much going plus I check bag since return flight ""No Carry-On"" stipulation included flight."
63387,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,Deleted flight using Hopper. Most convenient flight I've seen. I never give rating short review. I'm telling buddies get app.
63388,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,I glad friend told app. Before took hours every day check low price travel. Now keeps posted tell buy. Highly recommend.
63389,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,It flights Santa Maria California ... I picked November None I looked October December either... Frustrating ...
63390,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,I love fact cancel incurring fee also done app. Great idea great others wanted travel flights booked .
63391,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,Terrible. Downloaded quick test search; $400 expensive skyscanner. Will b deleting
63392,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"I've using Hopper 2 years, helped a lot, I wish good unfortunately hidden tools easy found :)"
63393,Hopper - Watch & Book Flights,"You verify ID booking confirmed, tell requirement authorise payment. Then leave hanging hours, without indication booking confirmed, unavailable via chat, phone, reply emails. I hope issue sorted, giving much confidence I doubt I'll again."

Hoping reap rewards patience strike perfect time score good deal flight. During time, I frustrated would notify everyday. In fact, post notifications. If I wanted update, I go time get it. However, towards end waiting period, Hopper updated started giving notifications, although daily frequency I desired, every 2-3 days. While I waited Hopper give good news, I watched anxious disappointment flight prices steadily increased Hopper continued tell wait. Then, weeks later flight prices increased $100, Hopper tells I stop waiting buy tickets anticipates prices increase point forward. Thanks nothing, Hopper. I really wanted work. It's great concept.
